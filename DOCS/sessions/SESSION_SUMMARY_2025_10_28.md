## WORK COMPLETED

### 1. Participant Flow Implementation (Phase 2.4)

#### Four New Pages Created

**WaitingRoom.tsx**
- Real-time waiting room for participants after role assignment
- Uses Supabase Realtime to listen for role assignment events
- Displays participant count and simulation info
- Auto-navigates to role reveal when role is assigned
- Checks for existing role assignment on mount (prevents stuck state)

**RoleReveal.tsx**
- Dramatic two-stage animation for role reveal
- Stage 1: Dark screen with fade-in role title
- Stage 2: Full character details appear
- Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions
- Auto-proceeds to role briefing after 8 seconds
- Manual "Continue" button available

**RoleBriefing.tsx**
- Complete character information display
- Role description section (background, traits, interests)
- Clan information with full member list (shows real user display names)
- Other clans section showing all simulation clans
- "Confirm Ready" button updates user status to 'active'
- Navigates to participant dashboard after confirmation

**ParticipantDashboard.tsx**
- Main participant interface (650+ lines)
- **Header:** Avatar, name, position, clan badge
- **Status Bar:** Current phase name and timer
- **4 Tabs:**
  - My Role: Character details and objectives
  - My Clan: Clan members and coordination (placeholder)
  - Process Overview: Timeline and current stage (placeholder)
  - Printable Materials: Print-friendly reference materials
- **Sidebar:**
  - Induction Advisor button (AI assistant - not yet implemented)
  - Quick navigation links
- Real-time phase updates via Supabase subscription

#### Routing Integration

**App.tsx Routes Added:**
- `/waiting-room/:runId` → WaitingRoom
- `/role-reveal/:runId` → RoleReveal
- `/role-briefing/:runId` → RoleBriefing
- `/participant-dashboard/:runId` → ParticipantDashboard

**Dashboard.tsx Participant Routing Logic:**
- Automatically routes participants based on user status:
  - `status = 'registered'` → `/waiting-room/:runId`
  - `status = 'role_assigned'` → `/role-reveal/:runId`
  - `status = 'active'` → `/participant-dashboard/:runId`
- Queries role assignment directly from roles table
- No longer depends on profile context (critical for performance)
- Extensive logging for debugging

#### User Flow Diagram

```

Participant sees phase status and can interact with simulation
```

### 2. Critical RLS Performance Fixes

#### Migration 00043: Fix auth.uid() Performance

**Problem Identified:**
- Supabase Performance Advisor flagged 15 policies
- Direct calls to `auth.uid()` caused per-row re-evaluation
- Profile loading timing out after 5+ seconds
- Dashboard queries taking 2-3 seconds

**Root Cause:**
PostgreSQL RLS re-evaluates `auth.uid()` for EVERY row when called directly in policy.

**Solution:**
Wrapped all `auth.uid()` calls in SELECT subquery:

```sql
-- Before (slow - re-evaluates per row):
WHERE assigned_user_id = auth.uid()

-- After (fast - evaluates once):
WHERE assigned_user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
```

**Policies Fixed (15 total):**
- sim_runs: 1 policy (participants can view their runs)
- roles: 1 policy (participants update own role)
- meetings: 3 policies (participant access)
- meeting_invitations: 3 policies (accept/decline/view)
- votes: 2 policies (submit/view own votes)
- king_decisions: 2 policies (king can edit)
- reflections: 3 policies (view/create/update own)
- facilitator_actions: 1 policy (log own actions)

**Expected Impact:**
- Profile loading: <100ms (was 5000ms timeout)
- Dashboard queries: <500ms (was 2-3s)
- 10-100x faster RLS policy evaluation

#### Migration 00044: Consolidate Duplicate Policies

**Problem Identified:**
- Supabase linter showing 30+ "multiple permissive policies" warnings
- Tables had both FOR ALL and specific operation policies
- Same permissions checked multiple times per query
- Example: "Facilitators can manage X" (FOR ALL) + "Facilitators insert X" (INSERT) = redundant

**Solution:**
Removed 17 redundant specific operation policies:

**Policies Removed:**
- clans: 3 (facilitators_insert, facilitators_update, facilitators_delete)
- roles: 3 (facilitators_insert, facilitators_update, facilitators_delete)
- phases: 3 (facilitators_insert, facilitators_update, facilitators_delete)
- simulation_templates: 4 (facilitators_insert, facilitators_update, facilitators_delete, facilitators_view_templates)
- ai_prompts: 1 (facilitators_view_ai_prompts)
- event_log: 1 (anyone_can_insert_events)
- public_speeches: 1 (facilitators_can_create_speeches)

**Results:**
- Reduced from 76 → 59 total policies
- Fewer policy evaluations per query
- Faster INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Cleaner policy structure

**Remaining "Duplicates" (Intentional):**
Some tables still show multiple SELECT policies:
- Facilitator SELECT + Participant SELECT policies
- These are NECESSARY for different access patterns
- Not true duplicates - they serve different purposes

#### Migration 00045: Drop Duplicate Indexes

**Problem Identified:**
- 4 pairs of identical indexes covering same columns
- Redundant indexes slow down writes
- Unnecessary disk usage

**Duplicate Index Pairs Found:**
1. `clans`: idx_clans_sequence + idx_clans_run_sequence
2. `phases`: idx_phases_sequence + idx_phases_run_sequence
3. `phases`: idx_phases_status + idx_phases_run_status
4. `roles`: idx_roles_run + idx_roles_run_id

**Solution:**
Dropped less descriptive index from each pair:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_clans_sequence;        -- Kept idx_clans_run_sequence
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_phases_sequence;       -- Kept idx_phases_run_sequence
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_phases_status;         -- Kept idx_phases_run_status
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_roles_run;             -- Kept idx_roles_run_id
```

**Results:**
- 4 fewer indexes to maintain
- Reduced disk usage
- Faster INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- No impact on query performance (identical coverage)

### 3. Earlier Critical Fixes (October 27-28)

#### Migration 00041: Fix is_facilitator() Circular Dependency

**Problem:**
- Migration 00021 broke `is_facilitator()` by changing it to `LANGUAGE sql STABLE`
- Created circular dependency:
  - users SELECT policy calls is_facilitator()
  - is_facilitator() queries users table
  - Query triggers RLS evaluation → infinite recursion → timeout

**Solution:**
- Restored `is_facilitator()` to `LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER` (original design)
- SECURITY DEFINER allows function to bypass RLS, preventing circular dependency
- Rebuilt users table policies to match original specification

**Policies Recreated:**
- Users can view their own profile
- Facilitators can view all users
- Authenticated users can view participants
- Users can update their own profile
- Facilitators can create users
- Service role can create users

#### Migration 00042: Restore All Cascaded Policies

**Problem:**
- Migration 00041's `DROP FUNCTION is_facilitator() CASCADE` removed 48 dependent policies
- Facilitators lost access to ALL simulations (showed 0 simulations instead of 3)

**Solution:**
Restored all RLS policies and helper functions that were dropped CASCADE:

**Functions Restored:**
- get_current_user_role_id()
- is_participant_in_run()

**Policies Restored (40+):**
- sim_runs: 4 policies
- access_tokens: 2 policies
- clans, roles, phases: 2 policies each
- meetings, meeting_invitations: 1 policy each
- public_speeches: 3 policies
- vote_sessions, vote_results, votes: 2, 2, 1 policies
- ai_context, ai_prompts, sim_run_prompts: 2, 2, 1 policies
- king_decisions, reflections: 2, 1 policies
- event_log, facilitator_actions: 2, 1 policies
- simulation_templates: 2 policies

#### Migration 00039: Allow Viewing Participants

**Problem:**
- ParticipantRegistration page couldn't list participants
- RLS blocked viewing other users

**Solution:**
- Added policy: authenticated users can view participant profiles
- Only exposes participants, not facilitators (security)
- Policy: `role = 'participant'`

#### Dashboard Routing Fix (Commit d062817)

**Problem:**
- Dashboard routing required `profile` from context
- Profile context was undefined due to timeout
- Participants stuck on waiting room

**Solution:**
**Dashboard.tsx:**
- Removed dependency on profile context for participant routing
- Query users table directly for `role` and `status` fields
- Check role assignment in roles table without requiring profile
- Removed profile from useEffect dependency array

**WaitingRoom.tsx:**
- Added initial check for existing role assignment on mount
- Previously only listened for future role UPDATE events
- Now checks if user already has role before showing waiting room
- Prevents "stuck in waiting room" bug

### 4. Testing & Validation

**Manual Testing Performed:**
- ✅ Participant registration flow
- ✅ Login as participant
- ✅ Automatic redirect to waiting room
- ✅ Role assignment by facilitator
- ✅ Real-time role detection in waiting room
- ✅ Automatic redirect to role reveal
- ✅ Role reveal animation plays correctly
- ✅ Continue to role briefing
- ✅ Clan member list displays with user names
- ✅ Confirm ready → navigate to participant dashboard
- ✅ Dashboard displays current phase
- ✅ Profile loading no longer times out
- ✅ Facilitators can view all simulations

**Performance Testing:**
- Profile loading: Instant (<100ms estimated)
- Dashboard queries: Fast (<500ms estimated)
- No more 5-second timeout

## TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

### RLS Performance Best Practices Learned

1. **Never call auth.uid() directly in policies**
   - Always wrap in SELECT: `(SELECT auth.uid())`
   - Prevents per-row re-evaluation
   - 10-100x performance improvement

2. **Avoid policy duplication**
   - Use FOR ALL when permissions are same for all operations
   - Only create specific policies when permissions differ
   - Example: Facilitators can manage (FOR ALL) vs Participants can only SELECT

3. **SECURITY DEFINER for helper functions**
   - Use when function needs to query same table as policy
   - Prevents circular dependency
   - Example: is_facilitator() queries users table, used by users policies

4. **Index consolidation**
   - Review for duplicate indexes covering same columns
   - Keep most descriptive index name
   - Reduces write overhead

### Participant Flow Architecture Decisions

1. **Status-Based Routing**
   - User status drives navigation (registered → role_assigned → active)
   - Dashboard acts as router, not destination
   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **Real-Time State Sync**
   - Supabase Realtime for role assignment detection
   - postgres_changes subscription on roles table
   - Instant updates without polling

3. **Defensive Programming**
   - Check existing role on WaitingRoom mount (prevents stuck state)
   - Extensive logging for debugging
   - Graceful handling of missing data

4. **Animation as UX Enhancement**
   - Framer Motion for smooth transitions
   - Dramatic reveal creates memorable moment
   - Timing carefully tuned (8s auto-advance)

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Database Performance
1. RLS policies can cause dramatic performance issues if not optimized
2. Supabase Performance Advisor is invaluable - use it regularly
3. auth.uid() wrapping is critical for performance
4. Duplicate policies and indexes add hidden overhead

### Architecture Decisions
1. Don't depend on slow-loading context for routing logic
2. Always check current state on mount, not just listen for changes
3. Real-time subscriptions are powerful but need defensive programming
4. Extensive logging is essential for debugging complex flows

### Development Process
1. Emergency fixes (timeouts) revealed deeper issues (RLS performance)
2. Addressing root cause is better than workarounds
3. Documentation drift happens fast - update docs frequently
4. Testing discipline prevents issues - we need it

### User Experience
1. Animation and timing create memorable moments
2. Automatic routing reduces cognitive load
3. Clear status indicators reduce confusion
4. Placeholder content is better than nothing, but feels incomplete
