# Clan of Bankers

## About the Clan
Our clan is the financial backbone of Kourion, managing the city-kingdom's wealth and resources. We have significant influence over economic activities and possess the unique power to provide loans to the state, supporting its budget in times of need. We believe in pragmatic governance, where financial stability and economic growth are prioritized above all else. Our wealth and resources give us leverage, but we must use them wisely to ensure continued prosperity for both our clan and the island city-kingdom.

## Key Priorities
The best King must understand the importance of financial stability and support policies that encourage economic growth. Our candidate should advocate for balanced budgets, controlled spending, and lower taxes on banking and financial transactions. We need to ensure that the first budget priorities are Debt Management, Economic Development, and Trade to keep the island's economy thriving and the city-kingdom prosperous.
An alliance with Kition is favourable for us because of their access to Persian imperial financing and extensive Phoenician commercial networks, which would increase our opportunities for lending and financial growth across the Mediterranean. An alliance with Salamis could prove detrimental to our interests due to their militaristic nature and traditional Greek values that often view financial accumulation with suspicion. Any decision that leads to economic instability, such as excessive military spending or high taxation, should be opposed.

## Attitude to Other Clans
We value the Merchants for their role in generating wealth and trade opportunities, which create demand for our financial services. The Artificers can contribute to economic growth through their innovations, but their projects must be financially viable and not drain the treasury. The Military Clan's focus on expensive military campaigns concerns us, as it could lead to unsustainable debt or economic instability. The Landlords are important partners as they provide collateral for loans and represent stable wealth, but their resistance to change can sometimes hinder economic development. The Philosophers can offer guidance, but their idealistic notions about debt forgiveness and economic equality could undermine the financial systems that sustain our prosperity.

## If Things Go Wrong
If the King's policies threaten our financial interests or economic stability, we have the power to restrict loans and credit, potentially causing a financial crisis that could force policy changes. We can also leverage our international connections to seek support from Persian or other foreign financial networks, though this would be a last resort that could compromise our independence.
