# Military Clan

## About the Clan
Our clan is large and mighty, commanding a loyal and disciplined army and navy that is the backbone of Kourion. As one of the two oldest and most noble clans of the city-kingdom (alongside the Landlords), we hold the unique right to bear arms. This is a significant responsibility that we have never taken lightly. Each member of our clan is raised to uphold and defend the laws and sacred traditions of Kourion. We believe that most changes pose a threat, as people tend to become weak and corrupt when they stray from established laws and traditions.

## Key Priorities
The ideal King should be a strategic thinker and a seasoned warrior who understands both land and naval warfare. Having our candidate ascend to the throne would be the best outcome, as he should avoid making too many promises to other clans and prevent becoming overly dependent on them. In the ongoing rivalry with Salamis and Kition, Kourion requires a robust army and fleet to defend our island territories. This necessitates a higher overall state budget, with increased taxes on all, especially the Merchants and Bankers. The top budget priorities must be the Navy, Coastal Defense, and Military Innovations. We need to expand our forces, strengthen our fleet, and build new fortifications around our harbors. Investment in military innovations is also crucial, along with an increase in the social budget to maintain internal stability; the growing discontent among ordinary citizens could otherwise lead to unrest, potentially exploited by external enemies seeking to control our strategic island position.
A decisive military alliance with Salamis is almost essential, and might even outweigh budgetary concerns. Salamis, a Greek city-kingdom where military tradition and strength still prevail, could help us restore our core values and defend against the foreign influences spreading across Cyprus. We understand that such an alliance would almost certainly mean conflict with Kition, but Kition, influenced by Phoenician merchants and Persian gold, lacks the warrior spirit and honor. They will not prevail in such a conflict, and we must make our choice.

## Attitude to Other Clans
We hold deep respect for the ancient and noble Clan of Landlords. We also appreciate the contributions of the Artificers, whose inventions have helped us win crucial naval battles and protect our coastal territories. However, the growing greed and decadence, particularly among the Bankers and Merchants, are slowly eroding the spirit of our island city-kingdom. Their sole focus on wealth and pleasure could weaken Kourion and jeopardize its independence. If they gain full power, our city-kingdom risks losing its strength and sovereignty to foreign influence.

## If Things Go Wrong
As the only clan with the right to bear arms, we carry the ultimate responsibility to choose the correct path to serve and protect our island city-kingdom. We will not hesitate to use our power to ensure Kourion remains strong, respected, and true to its Greek traditions.
