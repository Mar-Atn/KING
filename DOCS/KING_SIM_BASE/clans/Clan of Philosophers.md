# Clan of Philosophers

## About the Clan:
Our clan embodies the wisdom, knowledge, and moral conscience of Kourion. We are the keepers of ancient wisdom and advocates for reason, justice, and the well-being of all citizens. We believe that the true strength of a city-kingdom lies in the happiness and enlightenment of its people. Our role is to provide counsel to the rulers, ensure fair governance, and guide Kourion toward a future built on principles of virtue, knowledge, and balance.
Nothing stays unchanged with time. But change is dangerous and ordinary people are weak and susceptible to greed, obsession with power and entertainments. Traditions and laws protect us from the bad changes and bad behaviours, so they must be protected. However, we know, that rules and laws are all created by wise people, and, when day comes, right change could be introduced by the wise for the benefit of all.

## Key Priorities:
The best King must be a wise and just leader who values reason over power, knowledge over wealth, and the common good over personal ambition. Our candidate should prioritize Education, Public Welfare, and Fair Governance in the budget to promote social harmony and the enlightenment of the citizens. The King should seek to maintain a balanced approach, avoiding extremes in military aggression or economic exploitation.
We believe in a peaceful approach and are against unnecessary wars. The best way for Kourion is to remain unaligned, and allow Salamis and Kition to compete with each other, while Kourion grows stronger by staying independent and learning from both Greek and foreign wisdom. An alliance with Kition, a center of learning that blends Greek, Phoenician, and Persian knowledge, could enrich our intellectual pursuits, though we must be cautious of foreign influences that might corrupt our values. We are not inherently opposed to an alliance with Salamis if it promotes stability and Greek cultural traditions. We must oppose any policies that lead to tyranny, oppression, wars, or the marginalization of knowledge and wisdom.

## Attitude to Other Clans:
We respect the Artificers for their rational and innovative thinking, which can advance society when used wisely. We see the Merchants and Bankers as necessary contributors to the island's economy but caution against their pursuit of wealth at the expense of ethical principles and the common good. Their impact on political matters must be restricted. The Landlords are respected for their role in maintaining stability, but we must guide them toward more just and equitable land management practices. The Military Clan is a potential threat if they become overly aggressive or impose martial law; they should be reminded of the values of justice and restraint, especially given our island's position as a crossroads of cultures.

## If Things Go Wrong...
If the King disregards wisdom and justice, or if governance becomes tyrannical, we are prepared to lead a movement of peaceful dissent. We can incite the people to revolt through our teachings and influence or consider self-exile to a city-kingdom more aligned with our values, such as centers of learning in Kition or the Greek mainland. In the face of oppression, we will not remain silent but will use our influence to inspire change and restore balance and reason to the governance of Kourion.
