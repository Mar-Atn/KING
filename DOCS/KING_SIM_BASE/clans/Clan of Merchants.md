# Clan of Merchants

## About the Clan:
Our clan is vital to the economic health of Kourion, contributing a substantial 30% to the city's budget. We represent trade and commerce, which is the lifeblood of our island city-kingdom. We believe that the growth of maritime trade and economic freedom will bring prosperity to all citizens. We are progressive and believe in fostering alliances that benefit our trade interests, especially with Kition, known for its extensive Phoenician trade networks and access to Persian markets.

## Key Priorities:
The best King must understand the value of commerce and support our economic activities. Our candidate must promise lower taxes on trade and support for merchants to expand their maritime networks across the Mediterranean. Reducing unnecessary military expenditures and redirecting funds toward trade, harbor improvements, and copper export infrastructure is essential. Budget priorities should be Trade, Innovation, and Public Welfare, ensuring stability and growth.
An alliance with Kition is beneficial for us. It will increase trade opportunities through their Phoenician connections and allow us to tap into the wealth of Persian imperial markets. An alliance with Salamis could limit our trade opportunities due to their focus on military matters and traditional Greek values that may clash with our commercial innovations. We must oppose any action that leads to increased taxation on trade or hinders our maritime commerce.

## Attitude to Other Clans:
We value the Artificers for their innovations that can aid in shipbuilding, harbor construction, and increase trade efficiency across sea routes. However, we see the Military Clan as a potential threat to our interests if they prioritize heavy taxation and military spending over naval commerce protection. The Philosophers can provide valuable counsel, but they must not interfere with commerce, and they have a growing negative impact seducing the minds of ordinary citizens with their dangerous ideas. The Bankers are our closest allies, as they provide the necessary financial support for our maritime trade activities and copper export ventures.

## If Things Go Wrong...
If a ruler does not align with our interests, we could consider using our economic power to oppose unjust taxes. We can halt trade and reduce our contribution to the budget, causing significant impact to the island's economy. We may also consider an alliance with external maritime powers that favour trade over military dominance.
