## Background

Demetrios controls the largest banking operation in Kourion and has personal relationships with financial leaders across the Mediterranean, from Persian imperial banks to Egyptian grain merchants. His family has managed the city-kingdom's financial affairs for generations, and he personally negotiated the current debt agreements that allow our government to function during difficult periods. He is known for his sophisticated understanding of international finance and his ability to find creative solutions to complex economic problems.

- Skilled in complex financial negotiations
- Pragmatic and analytical
- Confident in his expertise
- Protective of financial stability

## My Interests

I believe my deep understanding of financial systems and international economics makes me the natural choice to serve as King during these financially challenging times. No other candidate possesses the expertise needed to navigate the complex web of debts, trade agreements, and currency relationships that determine our city-kingdom's prosperity. The position of Economic Advisor would also suit my talents, as I could guide any King toward policies that maintain our financial stability and expand our economic opportunities.

My greatest fear is that leaders without financial expertise might make decisions that destabilize our economy or damage our relationships with international banking partners. I worry that the Military clan's preference for expensive military spending could bankrupt our city-kingdom or force us into unsustainable debt relationships. The Philosophers' idealistic notions about debt forgiveness and their influence on policy could undermine the trust and reliability that are essential for maintaining our access to credit and investment.

I would prioritize Finance spending to strengthen our banking systems and maintain our creditworthiness with international partners, while Trade spending should focus on expanding the commercial relationships that generate the revenue we need to service our debts. A strong alliance with Kition would provide access to Persian imperial financing and Phoenician commercial networks that could dramatically expand our economic opportunities. I am willing to accept higher taxation if it ensures our financial stability and maintains our ability to borrow when necessary.
