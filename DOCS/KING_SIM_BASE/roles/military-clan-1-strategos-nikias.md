## Background

Nikias comes from a distinguished military family that has served Kourion for three generations, with his grandfather having fought in the great naval battles that secured our island's independence. He has personally commanded our war galleys in successful campaigns against pirate confederations, earning recognition for his strategic brilliance and unwavering courage under fire. His reputation as both a skilled tactician and honorable leader makes him widely respected throughout the military ranks and among the common citizens.

- Charismatic leader
- Suspicious of foreign influences

## My Interests

I have dedicated my life to serving Kourion, and I believe the time has come for me to serve as King. My military experience has taught me that strong leadership requires both courage and wisdom, and I am confident I can guide our island city-kingdom through these turbulent times. The role of Economic Advisor would also suit my talents, as military campaigns have given me deep understanding of resource management and strategic planning. I know that my clan brothers respect my achievements and would support my candidacy.

The thought of seeing our ancient traditions corrupted by foreign gold or merchant greed fills me with dread. If the Bankers or Merchants gain power, they might prioritize profit over honor, potentially leading us into alliances that compromise our sovereignty. I particularly worry about the Philosophers' influence on our youth, as their questioning of established order could weaken the discipline that has kept our island strong. The failure to elect a strong King could invite external enemies to exploit our internal divisions.

My primary goal is to strengthen our naval defenses and coastal fortifications, ensuring that no foreign power can threaten our independence. I would prioritize Military spending to expand our fleet and train more citizen-soldiers, while maintaining Social spending to keep our people united and loyal. An alliance with Salamis would honor our Greek heritage and provide the military partnership we need to face the growing threats from Persian-backed forces and Egyptian naval expansion.
