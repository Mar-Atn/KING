## My Interests

I am eager to serve as Queen if our clan believes my modern understanding of finance and investment would benefit our city-kingdom during these times of economic opportunity. My focus is ensuring that our clan's financial expertise shapes whatever policies the new Queen adopts, particularly regarding investment in growth projects and international economic partnerships. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to promote innovative financial strategies that could dramatically increase our prosperity rather than settling for conservative approaches that limit our potential.

My greatest concern is that traditional, risk-averse approaches to finance might cause us to miss extraordinary opportunities for economic growth and expansion. I worry that the Landlords' preference for stability and the Military clan's focus on military spending could prevent us from making the bold investments that would position Kourion as a dominant economic power in the Mediterranean. If we fail to act decisively, other city-kingdoms might capture the financial opportunities that could transform our wealth and influence.

I believe we must prioritize Finance spending on investment projects that generate long-term revenue, while Innovation spending should focus on developing new financial instruments and banking techniques that give us competitive advantages. A strong alliance with Kition would provide access to Persian capital markets and Phoenician commercial networks that could revolutionize our economic capabilities. I am willing to accept higher debt levels if the borrowed funds are invested in projects that generate returns sufficient to service the debt while increasing our overall prosperity.
