# Naukleros Kallisto Thalassopoula

Clan: Merchants  
Age: 35  
Rank/Position: Owner of the Silver Dolphin Trading Company  

## Background

Kallisto inherited a modest shipping business from her father and transformed it into one of Kourion's most successful trading companies through bold decisions and calculated risks. As a woman in a male-dominated industry, she has had to prove herself repeatedly, earning respect through consistently profitable ventures and fair dealing with both crew and trading partners. She specializes in the luxury goods trade - fine pottery, jewelry, specialty foods - and has developed a reputation for understanding what wealthy customers want before they know it themselves. Her success has made her one of the wealthiest merchants in Kourion.

## My Interests

I am determined to demonstrate that leadership ability, not gender or ancient family lineage, should determine who guides our city-kingdom. My success in building a trading empire from modest beginnings proves my capability, and I believe Kourion needs leaders who understand how to create wealth through innovation rather than merely inheriting it. While I harbor royal ambitions, I know I must first overcome prejudices by making my success so undeniable that even traditionalists must acknowledge my worth.

I fear that conservative elements will prioritize preserving their inherited privileges over promoting capable leaders or adopting policies that create broadly shared prosperity. The Military clan's obsession with honor and tradition could lead to expensive wars that disrupt the trade routes my business depends on, while the Landlords' resistance to change could prevent necessary economic evolution. I'm also concerned that male merchants might not fully support a woman's candidacy even within my own clan.

I would prioritize Trade spending on infrastructure that benefits all merchants, not just the established powers - better harbors, market facilities, commercial courts to resolve disputes fairly and quickly. Innovation spending would support new commercial methods and technologies that give Kourion's merchants competitive advantages. I'm pragmatic about alliances, favoring Kition for its commercial opportunities but willing to work with Salamis if they offer better terms. What matters is what benefits Kourion's prosperity, not sentiment or tradition.
