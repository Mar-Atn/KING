## My Interests

I do not seek the crown for personal glory, but I would accept it if my clan brothers believe I can best serve our military interests and preserve our ancient traditions. My focus is ensuring that whoever becomes King understands that our clan's strength and unity are essential for Kourion's survival. If I cannot serve as King, I would be honored to advise the ruler on military matters, using my experience to guide decisions that affect our warriors and our city's defense.

The greatest threat to our clan comes from those who would weaken our military traditions through compromise and foreign influence. I deeply distrust the Bankers and Merchants, who seem willing to sell our independence for profit, and I worry that their soft living has made them forget what it means to defend our island with blood and iron. The Philosophers' constant questioning of established order undermines the discipline and unity that our military requires, potentially creating divisions when we need solidarity most.

I would demand that any King prioritize Military spending above all else, ensuring our warriors have the best equipment, training, and support our city-kingdom can provide. Social spending must also remain strong to maintain the loyalty of our citizen-soldiers and their families. I firmly believe we must align with Salamis, our Greek brothers who share our warrior values and traditional ways, rather than compromise our honor through deals with Persian-influenced Kition or attempt to stand alone against the growing threats surrounding our island.
