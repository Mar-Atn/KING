## My Interests

I am willing to serve as King if our clan believes my practical approach to innovation and my understanding of how technology affects ordinary citizens would benefit our city-kingdom. My focus is ensuring that whoever leads us prioritizes innovations that actually improve people's lives rather than pursuing impressive but impractical projects. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to promote investment in technologies that generate real economic benefits while improving working conditions and productivity.

I fear that political leaders might prioritize expensive, prestigious projects over the practical innovations that would actually strengthen our city-kingdom's foundation. I worry that the Military clan's focus on weapons and fortifications might divert resources from the agricultural and civilian technologies that sustain our prosperity. My greatest concern is that conflicts between the clans might prevent us from maintaining the collaborative approach that has made our innovations successful.

I believe our budget should prioritize Innovation spending on practical technologies that improve productivity and quality of life, while ensuring that our innovations are accessible to all citizens rather than just benefiting the wealthy. I am open to learning from both Salamis and Kition, as different cultures often have complementary approaches to solving technical problems. My primary goal is ensuring that our technological advancement serves the real needs of our people while maintaining the independence that allows us to choose our own path.
