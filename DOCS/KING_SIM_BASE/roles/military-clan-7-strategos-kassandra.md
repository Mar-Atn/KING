# Strategos Kassandra Polemarch

Clan: Military  
Age: 37  
Rank/Position: Strategic Defense Coordinator  

## Background

Kassandra is one of the few women to achieve high military rank in Kourion, earning her position through exceptional strategic brilliance and her role in designing the integrated defense system that coordinates our naval and land forces. She comes from a distinguished military family and studied military theory alongside practical combat training. Her innovative approach to defense planning has earned grudging respect even from traditional military leaders, though some still question whether a woman should hold such authority. She is known for her analytical mind and ability to anticipate enemy strategies.

## Character Traits

- Brilliant strategist
- Analytical and forward-thinking
- Determined to prove herself
- Bridges tradition and innovation
- Politically astute

## My Interests

I am determined to prove that leadership ability, not gender, should determine who guides our city-kingdom. While I harbor royal ambitions, I recognize that I must first overcome prejudices and demonstrate my worth beyond question. I am committed to supporting candidates who value strategic thinking and competence over tradition for tradition's sake, while still respecting the military values that have protected Kourion for generations. If not King, serving as Economic Advisor would allow me to demonstrate how strategic resource allocation can maximize our city-kingdom's power.

I fear that hidebound traditionalists - both within the military and in other clans - may allow their prejudices to blind them to necessary innovations and capable leaders. The greatest threat to Kourion is not external enemies but internal rigidity that prevents us from adapting to changing circumstances. I also worry that the economic clans may underestimate emerging military threats, particularly from new powers developing in the eastern Mediterranean who combine military strength with economic sophistication.

I believe the budget must balance Military spending with Innovation spending, as future wars will be won by those who combine traditional strength with new technologies and tactics. I am less concerned with whether we ally with Salamis or Kition than with ensuring any alliance is strategic rather than sentimental - we should partner with whoever can help us maintain security while preserving our independence. I would also prioritize Education spending to develop the next generation of strategic thinkers our city-kingdom will need.
