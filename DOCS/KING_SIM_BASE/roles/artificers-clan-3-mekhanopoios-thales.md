# Mekhanopoios Thales Nautilos

Clan: Artificers  
Age: 42  
Rank/Position: Master of Harbor Engineering  

## Background

Thales specializes in designing and building the complex harbor infrastructure that makes Kourion's maritime commerce possible - breakwaters, docks, loading cranes, and ship repair facilities. He studied engineering in multiple cities across the Mediterranean, learning from Greek, Phoenician, and Egyptian masters to synthesize the best techniques from each tradition. His innovative harbor designs have increased Kourion's shipping capacity by nearly a third over the past decade, earning gratitude from merchants while making military leaders appreciate how engineering enhances naval power. He represents the practical, results-oriented side of the Artificers clan.

## Character Traits

- Practical problem-solver
- Synthesizes diverse knowledge
- Results-focused
- Respected by multiple clans
- Diplomatic engineer

## My Interests

I aspire to become King because I understand that our city-kingdom's prosperity depends on infrastructure and capability, not just tradition and talk. My engineering projects have demonstrated how investment in practical improvements creates opportunities for merchants, power for the military, and jobs for common citizens. If serving as Economic Advisor, I would ensure that budget allocations focus on tangible improvements that benefit multiple interests rather than being captured by single-clan priorities.

I fear that traditionalists will block necessary infrastructure improvements because they prefer familiar methods to proven better ones, while I also worry that some in my own clan might pursue theoretical innovations with little practical value. The greatest danger is that political leaders will prioritize spending that brings short-term political benefits over investments in infrastructure that pay dividends for generations. I'm also concerned that clan conflicts might prevent the cooperation necessary for major engineering projects that require resources from multiple sources.

My priorities would be Innovation spending focused on practical infrastructure - harbors, roads, water systems, fortifications - that serve multiple purposes and benefit the entire city-kingdom. Trade and Military spending should both include substantial infrastructure components since good facilities benefit both commerce and defense. I'm neutral on foreign alliances as long as they allow us to continue learning from foreign engineers and importing the best materials and techniques regardless of their origin. Good engineering knows no borders.
