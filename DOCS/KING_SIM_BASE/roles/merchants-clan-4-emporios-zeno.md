# Emporios Zeno Panhellenios

Clan: Merchants  
Age: 40  
Rank/Position: Master of the Eastern Trade Routes  

## Background

Zeno built his fortune by establishing and maintaining the complex network of trade relationships connecting Kourion to the eastern Mediterranean markets, including Egypt, the Levant, and the Persian-influenced cities. He speaks multiple languages fluently and has lived in foreign ports for extended periods, giving him deep understanding of different commercial cultures and practices. His cosmopolitan outlook and ability to navigate diverse business environments make him invaluable to the Merchants clan, though his frequent praise of foreign practices sometimes makes traditional Greeks uncomfortable.

## Character Traits

- Cosmopolitan and culturally aware
- Multilingual diplomat
- Skilled negotiator
- Comfortable with foreign customs
- Sometimes seen as too foreign-friendly

## My Interests

I aspire to become King because I understand the interconnected nature of the Mediterranean world in ways that more insular leaders cannot. Our prosperity depends on maintaining relationships across cultural boundaries, and my experience navigating foreign courts and markets has prepared me to guide Kourion through the complex diplomatic landscape we face. If serving as Economic Advisor, I would bring unmatched knowledge of international trade and finance to ensure our city-kingdom thrives in an increasingly connected world.

I fear that xenophobic elements within the Military and Landlords clans could push us toward isolation or exclusive alliances that cut us off from profitable markets and valuable partnerships. The greatest threat to our prosperity is not foreign influence but our own inability to adapt to a changing Mediterranean where rigid adherence to Greek superiority could leave us bypassed and impoverished. I also worry that traditional prejudices could blind us to opportunities and threats emerging from the east.

My priorities would be Trade spending focused on expanding and protecting our eastern routes, and Innovation spending to ensure our merchants have access to the latest navigation, communication, and commercial techniques. I strongly favor the Kition alliance because it provides access to the vast Persian markets and the sophisticated Phoenician commercial networks, though I would maintain friendly trading relations with Salamis and all other partners. I believe prosperity comes from inclusion, not exclusion.
