# Archon Herakles Geouchikos

Clan: Landlords  
Age: 53  
Rank/Position: Lord of the Central Plains  

## Background

Herakles controls the vast grain fields of central Kourion, the breadbasket that feeds our city-kingdom. His family claims descent from the original settlers who first cultivated these plains, and he takes this heritage with utmost seriousness. He is known as one of the most conservative members of the Landlords clan, deeply suspicious of change and fiercely protective of traditional land rights and hierarchies. His control over grain supplies gives him significant political leverage, though he rarely uses it overtly, preferring to work through traditional channels and established relationships.

## Character Traits

- Deeply conservative
- Suspicious of innovation
- Politically powerful but subtle
- Protector of tradition
- Proud of ancient lineage

## My Interests

I do not actively seek the crown, but if the clans called upon me, I would accept out of duty to preserve the traditions and values that have sustained Kourion since its founding. More importantly, I am determined to prevent any King from implementing dangerous innovations or foreign ideas that could undermine our agricultural foundation and social hierarchy. I will support candidates who respect the old ways and understand that the land and those who own it form the natural foundation of proper society.

I fear the corrupting influence of merchant wealth and banking schemes that treat land as mere collateral rather than sacred heritage. The Artificers' innovations threaten to disrupt traditional farming methods that have worked for generations, while Philosophers fill young minds with dangerous ideas about changing social arrangements that have maintained order since ancient times. I'm particularly concerned about any King who might try to redistribute land or change taxation in ways that undermine legitimate property rights.

My absolute priority is protecting Agriculture through traditional methods and preventing any interference with established land ownership and farming practices. I oppose excessive taxation on agricultural lands and resist any budget priorities that might drain resources from supporting traditional farming communities. I favor Salamis because they share our Greek values and respect for tradition, while I deeply distrust Kition's cosmopolitan mixing of peoples and ideas that could contaminate our pure Greek heritage.
