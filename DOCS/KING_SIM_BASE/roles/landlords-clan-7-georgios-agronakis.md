# Georgios Agronakis

Clan: Landlords  
Age: 33  
Rank/Position: Manager of the Southern Estates  

## Background

Georgios represents a younger generation of landlords who inherited smaller estates and have built them into profitable enterprises through hard work and practical innovation. Unlike the great noble families, he comes from lesser nobility and has earned his position in clan councils through demonstrated competence rather than ancient lineage. He has successfully integrated some Artificers' innovations into his farming operations - improved plows, better irrigation systems - while maintaining profitable relationships with Merchants who export his produce. His success makes him both admired and resented within the more traditional clan circles.

## Character Traits

- Hardworking and practical
- Open to useful innovation
- Entrepreneurial mindset
- Bridge between tradition and progress
- Ambitious but grounded

## My Interests

I am determined to prove that the Landlords clan can adapt to changing times without abandoning our core values. While I respect tradition, I believe we must embrace innovations that increase productivity and prosperity rather than clinging to methods simply because they're old. I don't seek the crown for myself - I'm too young and lack the ancient lineage - but I will support candidates who understand that protecting agriculture means making it profitable and competitive, not just preserving it like a museum piece.

I fear that the older, more conservative members of my own clan may resist necessary changes until it's too late, allowing merchants and bankers to buy up struggling farms and turn agricultural land into commercial real estate. At the same time, I worry that too much innovation too fast could disrupt the seasonal rhythms and traditional knowledge that remain essential to successful farming. The greatest danger is being trapped between hidebound tradition and reckless change, unable to find the practical middle ground.

I would prioritize Agriculture spending focused on infrastructure improvements and selective innovation that enhances productivity - better roads to markets, improved storage, practical tools. Trade spending is also important to ensure good markets for our products. I'm open to alliances with either Salamis or Kition based on which offers better markets for our agricultural products, and I'm particularly interested in arrangements that protect our farmers from predatory banking practices while still allowing access to credit for improvements.
