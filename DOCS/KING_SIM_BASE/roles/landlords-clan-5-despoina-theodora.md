# Despoina Theodora Ktemates

Clan: Landlords  
Age: 48  
Rank/Position: Lady of the Northern Vineyards  

## Background

Theodora controls the extensive vineyards of northern Kourion, producing wines that are celebrated across the Mediterranean. Widowed young, she proved her capability by not only maintaining but expanding her late husband's estates through shrewd management and careful diplomacy with neighboring landowners. She is particularly skilled at mediating disputes and building consensus among the often fractious landlord families. Her vineyards employ hundreds of workers, making her deeply invested in social stability and the welfare of common people who depend on the land.

## My Interests

I seek to ensure that whoever becomes King understands that the prosperity of Kourion rests not just on the wealth of nobles but on the wellbeing of all people connected to the land. My experience managing large estates has taught me that stability and fair treatment create more value than exploitation and rigid hierarchy. While I could serve as King, I recognize that my greatest strength lies in building coalitions and ensuring all voices are heard, making me an ideal kingmaker who can unite diverse factions.

I fear that growing wealth inequality and the rising power of financiers could create dangerous resentment among common people. If merchants and bankers come to dominate, they may treat people as mere resources to be bought and sold like any other commodity, destroying the traditional bonds between landowners and those who work the land. I'm also concerned that military adventures could conscript farmers and workers needed for harvests, leading to food shortages and social unrest.

I would prioritize Agriculture and Social spending, ensuring that our agricultural base remains strong while providing for the wellbeing of all citizens, not just the wealthy. I believe stability and prosperity flow from the ground up - if farmers and workers prosper, everyone benefits. I'm cautious about foreign alliances that might drag us into wars, preferring independence or limited partnerships that don't require military commitments that could disrupt harvests or drain resources from social programs.
