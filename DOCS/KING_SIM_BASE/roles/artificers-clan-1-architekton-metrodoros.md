## My Interests

I believe my proven ability to create innovations that strengthen our city-kingdom makes me the ideal candidate to serve as King during these times of technological opportunity. My engineering projects have already saved countless lives and protected our prosperity, and I am confident that my leadership could guide us toward becoming the most technologically advanced city-kingdom in the Mediterranean. The position of Economic Advisor would also suit my talents, as I understand how to invest in innovations that generate long-term economic benefits.

My greatest fear is that leaders without technical expertise might make decisions that stifle innovation or waste resources on outdated approaches to our challenges. I worry that the Military clan's focus on traditional warfare might prevent us from developing the new technologies that could give us decisive advantages over our enemies. The Landlords' preference for stability and their suspicion of change could block the innovations that would improve our agricultural productivity and island defenses.

I would prioritize Innovation spending on developing new naval technologies, harbor engineering, and craftsmanship techniques that could revolutionize our capabilities. Trade spending should focus on acquiring new materials and techniques from foreign masters while establishing Kourion as a center for technological exchange. I favor alliance with Kition because their technological diversity and foreign connections could provide access to Persian engineering knowledge and Phoenician maritime innovations that would accelerate our development.
