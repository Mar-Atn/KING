## Background

Alexandra has transformed her family's inland estates into the most productive agricultural operations on the island through careful management and innovative farming techniques.

## My Interests

I am willing to serve as King if our clan believes my practical experience and proven ability to manage resources effectively would benefit our city-kingdom during these challenging times. My focus is on ensuring that whoever leads us understands the fundamental importance of agricultural productivity and the need for policies that support sustainable land use. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to apply my experience in resource management to help balance the competing demands of our various clans.

My greatest concern is that political leaders might make decisions based on ideology or tradition rather than practical considerations, potentially harming our agricultural productivity and food security. I worry that the Merchants' focus on trade profits might lead to policies that favor copper exports over food production, making us dangerously dependent on imported grain. The Military clan's preference for expensive military spending could divert resources from the agricultural improvements that would strengthen our island's long-term prosperity.

I believe our budget should prioritize Agriculture spending on irrigation systems and storage facilities that improve our food security, while Trade spending should focus on developing reliable markets for our agricultural surplus. I am open to alliances with either Salamis or Kition, provided they guarantee stable markets for our products and do not interfere with our agricultural practices. My primary goal is ensuring that our policies support the farmers and landowners who produce the wealth that sustains our entire city-kingdom.
