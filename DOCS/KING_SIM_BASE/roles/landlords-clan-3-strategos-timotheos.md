## My Interests

The crown is not a perk, but a highest of responsibilities. I'm ready to take this responsibility, and use my takents and relations to make our city strong and prosperous. Whoever becomes King must understand the vital connections between agricultural stability and military security. My role is to guide our clan toward supporting candidates who will maintain the balance between economic prosperity and defensive preparedness that has kept our island safe and prosperous. If called upon to serve as Judge or Economic Advisor, I would bring my experience and wisdom. 

My greatest fear is that political leaders might treat military security and agricultural prosperity as competing interests rather than complementary necessities. I worry that the Merchants' focus on trade expansion might lead us into foreign entanglements that require military responses we cannot afford, while the Military clan's preference for expensive military spending could undermine the agricultural foundation that supports our entire economy. The failure to maintain proper balance between these concerns could leave us vulnerable to both external enemies and internal instability.

I believe our budget should carefully balance Agriculture and Military spending, ensuring that our food production remains secure while our defenses remain strong enough to protect our lands from external threats. I strongly favor an alliance with Salamis because their military traditions complement our agricultural strengths, and their Greek heritage means they understand the importance of the land-based prosperity that sustains military power. Any alliance must guarantee protection for our agricultural territories and respect for the traditional relationship between landowners and citizen-soldiers.
