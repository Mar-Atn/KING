## TODAY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS (OCTOBER 29, 2025)

### 1. Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements

**Real-Time Phase Synchronization**
- **Issue:** Participants needed manual refresh to see phase changes
- **Fix:** Created migration `00074_enable_realtime_subscriptions.sql`
- **Implementation:** Added sim_runs and phases tables to supabase_realtime publication
- **Result:** Phase changes now propagate instantly to all participants

**Clan Display Restoration**
- **Issue:** Clan information missing from participant dashboard after performance optimization
- **Root Cause:** Removed JOIN from roles query, but code still referenced `role.clans`
- **Fix:** Changed to find clan from `allClans` array: `const clanData = allClans.find(c => c.clan_id === role.clan_id)`
- **Result:** Clan name, logo, and details now display correctly

### 2. Strategic Planning Complete

**Comprehensive Documentation Review**
- Reviewed all core design documents (PRD, TECH_GUIDE, AI_DESIGN, UX_GUIDE)
- Identified gaps between design and implementation
- Validated current progress (~40% to MVP)
- Confirmed architecture is sound

**Key Strategic Decisions Made:**

**Decision 1: Full 4-Block Metacognitive AI Architecture**
- Not simplifying despite complexity
- Proven in THERAPIST project (production therapy app)
- Estimated 10-15 days implementation (revised from 15-20)
- Memory compression: 3-4 pages max (adjustable)

**Decision 2: MVP Scope - AI-Augmented with Voice (Option B+)**
- Timeline: 8-10 weeks to production-ready MVP
- No hard deadline - natural pace for quality
- Full AI character system with voice integration
- Parallel development: Cognitive model ‚Üí Voice layer

**Decision 3: Voice Integration Strategy**
- Full conversational AI (speeches + Q&A + meetings)
- Use proven THERAPIST patterns (ElevenLabs + FastAPI)
- Voice + Text chat in parallel (fallback by design)
- Text chat as support mode + AI-AI communication

**Decision 4: Meeting Constraint**
- Max 1 AI per mixed human-AI voice meeting
- Technical limitation, strategic simplification
- AI-only meetings use text (no voice needed)

## STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### AI Character System Architecture

**4-Block Metacognitive System** (adapted from THERAPIST's 3-component):

**Block 1: Fixed Context** (Static, simulation-level)
- Simulation rules and process
- Available actions and constraints
- Architecture awareness
- "NOT BEING A HELPFUL ASSISTANT" behavioral instructions
- Storage: `ai_prompts` table (template-level)

**Block 2: Identity** (Mostly static, character-level)
- Character personality (from roles.character_traits)
- Clan alignment (from clans.key_priorities)
- Values and motivations (from roles.interests)
- Communication style
- Storage: `ai_context.identity_context` (JSONB)

**Block 3: Memory** (Dynamic, bounded)
- Meeting summaries
- Speech transcripts (compressed)
- Relationships with other participants
- Key decisions and outcomes
- **Maximum size: 3-4 pages (~2500 words)**
- Compression after each event
- Storage: `ai_context.memory_context` (JSONB)

**Block 4: Goals & Plans** (Dynamic, strategic)
- Strategic objectives (aligned with clan)
- Current plans (who to meet, what to say)
- Voting strategy
- Hypotheses about other participants
- Next actions
- Storage: `ai_context.goals_context` (JSONB)

**Reflection Workflow:**
```
Event Occurs (meeting, speech, vote)
        ‚Üì
Event Completes ‚Üí Transcript captured
        ‚Üì
Reflection Triggered (POST /api/ai/reflect)
        ‚Üì
MAIN PERSONA (Claude) receives:
  - All 4 blocks (current state)
  - Event transcript
        ‚Üì
MAIN PERSONA analyzes and updates:
  - Block 2 (Identity) - rarely changes
  - Block 3 (Memory) - adds/merges/discards
  - Block 4 (Goals) - adapts strategy
        ‚Üì
Updated blocks saved to database (new version)
        ‚Üì
Next event uses updated context
```

**Key Innovation:** Agent actively curates its own memory (metacognition), not passive storage.

### Voice Integration Architecture

**Pattern:** Same cognitive system (4 blocks) for text and voice

```
Participant Voice ‚Üî ElevenLabs Agent (ASR/TTS)
                         ‚Üì
              FastAPI /v1/chat/completions
              (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
                         ‚Üì
              4-Block Context + Intent Notes
              (Fixed + Identity + Memory + Goals)
                         ‚Üì
                   Claude (MAIN PERSONA)
```

**Intent Notes System:**
- MAIN PERSONA generates behavioral instructions before event
- Example: "Explore their interests. Be curious but guarded. Don't reveal clan plans."
- Intent notes injected into voice system prompt
- Guides voice avatar behavior while maintaining character consistency

**Dual Channel Support:**
- Voice channel (primary) - ElevenLabs real-time conversation
- Text chat (parallel) - Direct API calls
- Both feed into unified transcript
- Same reflection process for both channels
- Fallback: Voice fails ‚Üí Text continues seamlessly

```sql
ALTER TABLE roles ADD COLUMN elevenlabs_agent_id TEXT;
```

2. **Add `status` field to meetings table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN status TEXT
  CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled'))
  DEFAULT 'scheduled';
```

3. **Add `transcript` field to meetings table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN transcript TEXT;
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN duration_seconds INT;
```

4. **Add `channel` field to meeting_messages table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE meeting_messages ADD COLUMN channel TEXT
  CHECK (channel IN ('voice', 'text'))
  DEFAULT 'text';
```

### Priority 2: Start Sprint 1 - Voting System (Week 1)
**Begin implementation Monday:**

1. Create vote session management API
2. Build ballot UI (clan nominations)
3. Implement vote submission validation
4. Create results calculation with 2/3 threshold

2. ‚úÖ **Clan display missing** - Fixed Oct 29 (ParticipantDashboard.tsx)
3. ‚úÖ **Strategic planning gap** - Completed Oct 29 (5 reference docs)

### Remaining Critical Issues

1. **No Testing Infrastructure** (STILL CRITICAL)
   - Unit Tests: 0%
   - Integration Tests: 0%
   - E2E Tests: 0%
   - **Plan:** Add testing in Sprint 1 alongside voting module
   - **Target:** 50%+ coverage by Sprint 4

2. **Documentation Slightly Outdated**
   - README.md needs update (Phase 2.4)
   - KING_TECH_GUIDE.md needs AI/voice sections
   - **Plan:** Complete during Sprint 0 extension (this week)

### Medium Priority

3. **Participant Dashboard Incomplete**
   - My Clan tab: Has basic content now (clan display fixed)
   - Process Overview tab: Needs content
   - **Plan:** Sprint 1 alongside voting module

4. **Phase-Specific UI Missing**
   - Most phases show generic screen
   - **Plan:** Add incrementally during Sprint 1-7

### Low Priority

5. **No Error Boundaries**
   - Runtime errors crash app
   - **Plan:** Add in Sprint 8 (polish phase)

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT (UPDATED)

### Risks Mitigated ‚úÖ

1. **AI Architecture Uncertainty** ‚Üí **RESOLVED**
   - Decision: Full 4-block system (proven in THERAPIST)
   - Confidence: High (production-tested patterns)

2. **Voice Integration Complexity** ‚Üí **RESOLVED**
   - Decision: Use proven THERAPIST patterns
   - Confidence: High (working reference implementation)

3. **MVP Scope Ambiguity** ‚Üí **RESOLVED**
   - Decision: AI-Augmented with Voice (8-10 weeks)
   - Confidence: High (detailed sprint plan exists)

### Remaining Risks

**Medium Risk:**

1. **Memory Compression Algorithm**
   - Risk: AI loses important context over time
   - Mitigation: Test with long simulations (20+ events)
   - Confidence: Medium (inspired by THERAPIST, needs validation)

2. **Real-time Voice Coordination**
   - Risk: Multiple participants speaking at once
   - Mitigation: Turn-taking UI cues, test with 3-4 participants
   - Confidence: Medium (needs testing)

3. **Claude API Costs**
   - Risk: High costs with 8 AI characters
   - Mitigation: Use Claude Haiku for simple responses, Sonnet for complex
   - Confidence: High (cost predictable, can optimize)

**Low Risk:**

4. **Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: Unknown behavior at 30 users
   - Mitigation: Load test before production
   - Status: Acceptable (infrastructure proven at scale)

5. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Risk: Modern stack may not work on old browsers
   - Mitigation: Test on common browsers, set requirements
   - Status: Low concern (target modern browsers)
