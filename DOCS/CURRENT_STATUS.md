## TECHNICAL DEBT INVENTORY

### Critical Issues

1. **Authentication Timeout Workarounds (Oct 27-28)**
   - **Issue:** Profile loading times out after 5 seconds
   - **Workaround:** Added timeout handling in AuthContext
   - **Root Cause:** RLS policy performance (partially fixed Oct 28)
   - **Status:** Improved with auth.uid() optimization, but workarounds remain
   - **Action Required:** Remove timeout workarounds after full RLS review

2. **Incomplete RLS Policy Review**
   - **Issue:** Multiple policies flagged by Supabase Performance Advisor
   - **Fixes Applied:** Migrations 00043-00045 (auth.uid() wrapping, deduplication)
   - **Remaining:** Systematic review of all 59 policies needed
   - **Impact:** Potential performance degradation at scale

3. **No Testing Infrastructure**
   - **Unit Tests:** 0%
   - **Integration Tests:** 0%
   - **E2E Tests:** 0%
   - **Impact:** High risk of regressions, especially with complex auth/RLS logic

### Medium Priority

4. **Participant Dashboard Incomplete**
   - **Issue:** Tabs exist but content is minimal
   - **Impact:** Poor participant experience during simulation

5. **Phase-Specific UI Missing**
   - **Issue:** Most phases show generic "phase active" screen
   - **Impact:** Participants don't know what to do during each phase

6. **No Error Boundaries**
   - **Issue:** Runtime errors crash entire app
   - **Impact:** Poor UX, hard to debug production issues

### Low Priority

7. **Printable Materials Layout**
   - **Issue:** Print CSS not fully optimized
   - **Impact:** Materials may not print cleanly

8. **No Offline Graceful Degradation**
   - **Issue:** App requires constant internet connection
   - **Impact:** Poor UX if WiFi drops during simulation

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High-Risk Items

1. **AI System Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Underestimated effort to implement 4-block context system
   - **Impact:** Core product differentiator may not work as designed
   - **Mitigation:** Build simple prototype first, iterate

2. **Voice Integration Technical Challenges**
   - **Risk:** ElevenLabs API may not support group conversations
   - **Impact:** Human-AI meetings may be text-only
   - **Mitigation:** Test ElevenLabs thoroughly, have fallback to text

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - **Risk:** No load testing done, unknown behavior at 30 users
   - **Impact:** Simulation may crash during live event
   - **Mitigation:** Load test before first production run

### Medium-Risk Items

4. **Testing Debt**
   - **Risk:** No tests means high regression risk
   - **Impact:** Bugs in production, slow development velocity
   - **Mitigation:** Start writing tests now, focus on critical paths

5. **Documentation Drift**
   - **Risk:** Docs already outdated, will get worse
   - **Impact:** Onboarding new developers difficult, knowledge loss
   - **Mitigation:** Update docs regularly, enforce doc-first discipline

6. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk:** PRD is very ambitious, temptation to add more
   - **Impact:** MVP delivery delayed
   - **Mitigation:** Strict MVP scope adherence, defer nice-to-haves

### Low-Risk Items

7. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **Risk:** Modern React/TypeScript may not work on old browsers
   - **Impact:** Some participants unable to access
   - **Mitigation:** Test on common browsers, set minimum requirements

---

## CONCLUSION

### Current State Summary

The New King SIM Web App is **35-40% complete toward MVP** with a solid technical foundation but significant feature gaps. The core infrastructure (database, authentication, participant flow, simulation configuration) is production-ready, but critical gameplay modules (meetings, voting, AI system, reflection) are not yet implemented.

### Strengths
- Clean, scalable architecture
- Well-designed database schema with RLS security
- Working participant onboarding flow
- Functional facilitator simulation creation
- Performance-optimized (after Oct 28 fixes)

### Critical Gaps
- No AI character implementation (0%)
- No voting system (0%)
- No meeting functionality (0%)
- No reflection/debrief system (0%)
- Zero test coverage
- Documentation outdated

### Path to MVP

**Realistic Timeline:** 25-35 additional development days (~5-7 weeks)

**Must-Have for MVP:**
1. Voting module (3-4 days)
2. Basic meetings (5-7 days, text-only)
3. Public speech recording (2-3 days)
4. AI character system (7-10 days, simplified)
5. Reflection forms (2-3 days)
6. Testing infrastructure (3-4 days)
7. Documentation updates (2-3 days)

**Total:** 24-34 days minimum

### Recommendation

**Proceed with phased MVP approach:**

**MVP 1.0 (Human-Only):** 2 weeks
- Complete voting module
- Add basic meetings (text)
- Public speeches
- Skip AI system initially
- Focus on human participant experience
- **Goal:** Validate simulation flow with humans only

**MVP 1.5 (AI-Augmented):** 3-4 weeks
- Add AI character system (simplified)
- AI voting and simple decision-making
- Text-based AI meetings
- **Goal:** Validate human-AI interaction

**MVP 2.0 (Full Product):** Additional 2-3 weeks
- Voice integration
- Advanced AI behaviors
- Full reflection and debrief
- Analytics dashboard
- **Goal:** Complete PRD vision

**Total to MVP 2.0:** 7-9 weeks from now

This phased approach reduces risk, allows for iterative testing, and provides early validation of core concepts before investing in complex AI and voice systems.
