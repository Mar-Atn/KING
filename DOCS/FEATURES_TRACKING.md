## TOTAL ESTIMATED WORK TO MVP

**MVP 1.0 (Human-Only, No AI):** 15-20 days
- Voting + Meetings + Public Speeches + Stage completion

**MVP 1.5 (AI-Augmented):** Additional 10-15 days
- Basic AI system + AI voting + text meetings

## CONCLUSION

**Current Status:** ~35-40% complete to MVP 1.5 (AI-Augmented)

**Strengths:**
- Excellent foundation (auth, database, real-time, security)
- Complete participant onboarding flow
- Functional simulation configuration
- Performance-optimized RLS policies

**Critical Gaps:**
- No voting system (0%)
- No meetings system (0%)
- No AI implementation (0%)
- No public speeches (0%)
- Minimal reflection/debrief (0%)

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Sprint 1 (2 weeks):** Voting module - Get elections working
2. **Sprint 2 (2 weeks):** Basic meetings (text-only) - Enable consultations
3. **Sprint 3 (2 weeks):** Public speeches + Stage completion - Full human flow
4. **Sprint 4 (2 weeks):** Basic AI system - Simplified AI participants
5. **Sprint 5 (1 week):** Testing + Polish - Prepare for pilot run

**Timeline to MVP 1.5:** 9 weeks from now (early January 2026)
