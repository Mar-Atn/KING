## Kourion Needs a New KING!

Ancient Cyprus, 5th-4th century BCE. Cyprus is a strategic island crossroads of Greek, Phoenician, and Persian civilizations. Three city-kingdoms (Kourion, Kition, Salamis) are on the brink of conflict. External threats loom from Egyptian, Persian, and Assyrian powers, as well as pirates getting out of control.

The mighty city-kingdom of Kourion has lost its King without a heir. You are the noble citizens of Kourion, representing the most noble families belonging to one of the major clans. You gether here today to elect a new supreme ruler, following the ancient sacred tradition. 

The Kingdom shall not remain without a King. If the King is not elected today - turmoil and unrest might start among ordinary citizens, who can not imagine life without a legitimate King, and enemies will not hesitate to use their chance and take control of our glorious city.

## King's main decisions
Once elected the new King will have lifelong powers as supreme ruler of our glorious city. His first order is expected to have these decisions:
1. **Taxes (next year):** the King must decide on taxes for Agriculture, Trade, Banking and Craft, setting each lower, higher or keeping as is. 	
2. **Budget (next year):**	the King will set Priority #1, Priority #2 and Priority #3, each one selected out of 6 priorities: defense, culture, agriculture, banking, trade, craft
3. **Appointments:** The King will appoint his *Economic Advisor* and *Senior Judge*  
4. **International Affairs:** The King can declare New Alliances (with Salamis or Kition) or declare War (Salamis, Kition, Egypt, Assyria, Pirates)
5. **Other King's decisions:** as the supreme ruler the King can reward, appoint, arrest, send to exile...

## General Interests
For every noble citizen, becoming the King is the highest honour. Becoming one of the two senior King's Advisors is also a great privilege.
Each clan's strongest interest is to promote its candidate to become the new King or, at minimum, one of the two senior King's Advisors. If another clan's representative becomes the King, each clan wants its legitimate clan interests reflected in the King's agenda. There is a high risk for any clan if it falls out of favour with the new King.
Once new King is elected each Clan has to take the oath of allegiance to the new King, and also can make final decisions or statements

## Strategic Setting
- **Key Rivals in Cyprus**: Kition (Phoenician-influenced, trade and wealth oriented, culturally different) and Salamis (strong military, close cultural kinship)
- **Economic Foundations:** Maritime trade; Grain, wine, olive oil production; Strategic Harbors critical for naval defense and commerce.
