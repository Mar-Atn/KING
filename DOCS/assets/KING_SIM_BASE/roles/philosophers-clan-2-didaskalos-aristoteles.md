## My Interests

I am willing to serve as King if our clan believes my understanding of political theory and practical governance would benefit our city-kingdom during these complex times. My focus is ensuring that our philosophical principles are applied in ways that actually improve the lives of our citizens rather than remaining abstract ideals. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to promote policies that balance competing interests while maintaining the ethical foundations that make our society worth preserving.

I fear that idealistic approaches to governance might ignore practical realities and lead to policies that sound noble but fail to address real problems. I worry that the Military clan's focus on honor and tradition might prevent necessary adaptations to changing circumstances, while the Merchants' emphasis on immediate profits could sacrifice long-term stability for short-term gains. My greatest concern is that political leaders might make decisions based on emotion or self-interest rather than careful analysis of consequences.

I believe our budget should balance Education and Culture spending with practical investments in the infrastructure and institutions that support good governance. I am open to alliances with either Salamis or Kition, provided they are based on mutual respect and shared values rather than mere convenience or profit. My primary goal is ensuring that our city-kingdom develops policies that are both philosophically sound and practically effective, creating a model of governance that other societies might wish to emulate.
