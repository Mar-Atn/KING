## My Interests

I do not seek the crown for myself - I am a soldier, not a politician. However, I am absolutely committed to ensuring that whoever becomes King understands that military strength and discipline are the foundations upon which all other prosperity rests. Without strong warriors trained in the traditional ways, our city-kingdom would fall to the first enemy with the will to take it. I will support candidates who respect military tradition and understand that cutting military funding is cutting our own throats.

I fear that the merchants and bankers view soldiers as mere expenses rather than the guardians of everything they hold dear. Their constant pressure to reduce military spending and redirect resources to trade ventures or banking schemes fills me with dread - they are sacrificing long-term security for short-term profits. I am also deeply concerned about the Philosophers' influence on our youth, teaching them to question rather than to obey, which undermines the discipline essential for military effectiveness.

My priorities are clear: Military spending must be protected and increased, focusing on proper training, equipment, and support for our traditional heavy infantry alongside the navy. Social spending to maintain the warrior class and honor our veterans is essential. I strongly support the Salamis alliance, as they share our Greek martial values and would be reliable allies in battle, unlike the merchant-minded Phoenicians of Kition who would likely abandon us if trade interests conflicted with military obligations.
