## Background

Kleomenes commands the eastern naval squadron responsible for protecting Kourion's trade routes from pirates and foreign threats. He rose through the ranks through exceptional naval tactics and has secured numerous victories against Cilician pirates, earning him respect among both military personnel and merchants who benefit from safe waters. Unlike some of his clan brothers, Kleomenes understands the economic importance of maritime security and maintains working relationships with merchant captains. His balanced approach to military matters makes him a bridge between traditional military values and practical economic necessities.

## My Interests

I seek to become King because I understand that true strength comes from both military power and economic prosperity - you cannot have one without the other. My experience commanding fleets has taught me that protecting commerce is as important as winning battles, and I believe this balanced perspective is what our city-kingdom needs. If not King, I would serve excellently as Economic Advisor, as I understand how military spending and economic prosperity must be carefully balanced to ensure both security and wealth.

I fear that rigid military traditionalists might alienate the economic clans whose resources fund our defenses, while I also worry that merchant-minded leaders might neglect our security until it's too late. The greatest danger would be a King who doesn't understand that naval power protects trade, and trade funds naval power - breaking this cycle would weaken us fatally. I'm also concerned that internal divisions could leave our waters vulnerable to pirates or foreign navies at a time when maritime threats are increasing.

My priority would be Military spending focused specifically on naval expansion and coastal fortifications, but balanced with Trade spending to ensure the prosperity that funds our defenses. I support maintaining strong relationships with both Salamis (for military cooperation) and Kition (for trade), believing that wise diplomacy can give us the benefits of both alliances without becoming dependent on either. I would ensure that our navy protects merchant ships as vigorously as it defends our shores.
