## Background

Sokrates leads the most respected school of philosophy in Kourion and has trained many of the young leaders who now serve in various clan positions throughout our city-kingdom. His family has served as teachers and advisors for generations, and he is known for his ability to see beyond immediate political concerns to the deeper ethical questions that should guide our decisions. His reputation for wisdom and integrity has made him a trusted advisor to leaders across all clans, even those who disagree with his positions.

- Committed to ethical principles
- Skilled at seeing long-term consequences
- Respected across clan lines
- Focused on justice and fairness

## My Interests

I do not seek the crown for personal ambition, but I would accept it and I would use the position to ensure that our city-kingdom's decisions are guided by wisdom and ethical principles rather than mere self-interest. My primary goal is to serve as a voice for the common good, helping our people understand that true prosperity comes from justice and virtue rather than wealth and power alone. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to promote policies that benefit all citizens while maintaining the moral foundation that makes our society worth defending.

I fear that the pursuit of wealth and power might corrupt our leaders and cause them to abandon the principles that have made our city-kingdom a beacon of civilization. I worry that the Bankers' focus on profit and the Merchants' emphasis on trade expansion could lead to decisions that enrich a few while impoverishing many. My greatest concern is that conflicts between the clans might destroy the unity and trust that are essential for a just and prosperous society.

I believe our budget should prioritize Education and Culture spending to ensure that our citizens have the wisdom and knowledge needed to participate meaningfully in our democracy. Innovation spending should focus on developments that improve the human condition rather than merely increasing military or economic power. I favor full independence because I believe that true wisdom comes from understanding ourselves and our own values, not from dependence on foreign powers who may not share our commitment to justice and human dignity.
