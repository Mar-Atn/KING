Rank/Position: Director of Commercial Banking  

## Background

Iris oversees the commercial banking operations that provide credit to merchants, shipbuilders, and other businesses throughout Kourion. She comes from a banking family of modest origins and rose through merit by demonstrating exceptional ability to assess credit risk and structure profitable loans. Unlike some of her more conservative clan members, Iris believes that calculated lending drives economic growth and that banks should be partners in prosperity rather than mere hoarders of gold. Her lending decisions have helped many successful businesses grow while maintaining sound lending practices that keep default rates low.

## My Interests

I seek to ensure that whoever becomes King understands that smart lending and financial facilitation are essential for economic prosperity - hoarding wealth in vaults doesn't create jobs or opportunities. My experience evaluating hundreds of business proposals has taught me to distinguish between genuine opportunity and reckless speculation, and this judgment is exactly what Kourion needs in its leadership. While I could serve as King, I might be even more effective as Economic Advisor, where my financial expertise would directly shape policy.

I fear that overly conservative elements within my own clan might strangle economic growth through excessive caution, preventing the credit expansion that merchants and innovators need to create prosperity. At the same time, I worry that aggressive merchants might push for reckless lending or financial deregulation that could lead to a banking crisis and economic collapse. The Military clan's expensive projects could also crowd out productive lending by absorbing all available capital for non-productive military spending.

I would prioritize Trade and Finance spending in balance - supporting the commercial infrastructure that creates opportunities while ensuring the banking system has adequate capital and proper oversight. I also support Innovation spending, as new technologies and methods can dramatically improve productivity and create new lending opportunities. I favor the Kition alliance because it opens access to sophisticated Persian financial systems and larger commercial networks, though I would maintain lending relationships with all creditworthy borrowers regardless of politics.
