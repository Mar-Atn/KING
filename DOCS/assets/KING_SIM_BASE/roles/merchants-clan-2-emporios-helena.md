## My Interests

I'm not one of those seeking the crown just for their own glory and flatter self-esteem. But I know I might be a great ruler for our city in these troubled times. I am determined to ensure that whoever becomes King understands the importance of maintaining our established trading relationships and avoiding reckless changes that could disrupt our prosperity. My role is to guide our clan's support toward candidates who will protect our commercial interests while respecting the stability that has made our success possible. If I were to serve as Economic Advisor, I would bring the wisdom of experience to prevent costly mistakes that could harm our city-kingdom's financial foundation.

I fear that younger, more aggressive merchants might push for rapid expansion that could anger our traditional partners or lead us into dangerous foreign entanglements. The Military clan's preference for Salamis concerns me because it might force us to abandon profitable relationships with eastern markets, while their focus on expensive military spending could burden our trade with heavy taxation. I also worry that political instability could damage the trust that is essential for long-term commercial success.

I believe our budget should prioritize Trade spending on infrastructure improvements that benefit all merchants, not just the wealthy ship-owners, and ensure that our traditional copper trade remains profitable. Finance spending should focus on maintaining stable currency and reliable banking systems that support steady commerce rather than speculative ventures. While I understand the appeal of Kition's markets, I prefer maintaining our independence and working with all partners rather than becoming too dependent on any single alliance that might limit our trading flexibility.
