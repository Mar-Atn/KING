## My Interests

While I respect the experience of my senior colleagues, I believe our clan needs fresh leadership that can navigate the complex challenges facing Kourion. I am willing to serve as King if called upon, but I am equally prepared to support a candidate who truly understands the need for military innovation and strategic flexibility. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to bridge the gap between military necessities and financial realities, ensuring our defenses remain strong without bankrupting our city-kingdom.

I fear that rigid adherence to old ways could leave us vulnerable to enemies who have adapted new tactics and technologies. The Merchants' focus on profit over security concerns me, but I also worry that complete rejection of their innovations might weaken our position. My greatest concern is that political divisions within our city-kingdom could prevent us from responding effectively to external threats, whether they come from Egyptian fleets, Assyrian armies, or Persian gold undermining our allies.

I would prioritize a balanced approach to governance, ensuring that Military spending focuses on both traditional strengths and new innovations in naval warfare. I believe we must invest in Innovation to develop better ships, weapons, and fortifications, while maintaining adequate Social spending to keep our citizen-soldiers motivated and loyal. Regarding alliances, I favor careful negotiation with both Salamis and Kition, choosing the partnership that best serves our long-term security rather than rushing into emotional decisions based on cultural preferences alone.
