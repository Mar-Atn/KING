# Kyrios Philippos Agronomos

Clan: Landlords  
Age: 44  
Rank/Position: Master of the Western Olive Groves  

## Background

Philippos oversees the most productive olive groves in western Kourion, lands that have been in his family for eight generations. He is renowned throughout the Mediterranean for the quality of his olive oil, which commands premium prices in both Greek and Phoenician markets. Unlike some traditional landlords, Philippos has carefully studied agricultural innovations and selectively adopted improvements that increase yields without compromising quality. His success has made him wealthy and influential, and he represents a pragmatic faction within the clan that values prosperity alongside tradition.

- Practical and results-oriented
- Quality-focused
- Open to proven innovations
- Commercially savvy
- Dignified but approachable

## My Interests

I believe I would make an excellent King because I understand both the traditional values that have sustained Kourion and the practical realities of competing in Mediterranean markets. My success in producing the finest olive oil shows my ability to honor tradition while embracing improvements, and this balanced approach is what our city-kingdom needs. If serving as Economic Advisor, I would bring extensive experience in managing resources and understanding how agricultural prosperity forms the foundation of all other wealth.

I fear that excessive focus on trade and banking could undermine the agricultural base that has sustained our island for centuries. Merchants may see land as just another commodity to be bought and sold for profit, rather than as the sacred heritage passed down through generations. I'm also concerned that military spending could drain resources needed for agricultural infrastructure, while heavy taxation on land could make farming unprofitable and drive people from the fields into overcrowded cities.

My priority would be Agriculture spending focused on irrigation systems, storage facilities, and quality improvements that enhance rather than replace traditional methods. Trade spending should support finding better markets for our agricultural products rather than importing foreign goods that compete with local production. I prefer the Salamis alliance because Greek markets appreciate quality over mere quantity, and their traditional values align with our own, though I'm pragmatic enough to sell to anyone who pays fair prices.
