# Lieutenant Andreas Polemistes

Clan: Military  
Age: 29  
Rank/Position: Commander of the City Guard  

## Background

Andreas is the youngest officer to ever command Kourion's prestigious City Guard, earning his position through exceptional skill in urban defense tactics and his ability to maintain order during civil unrest. He comes from a military family of modest means and has worked his way up through merit rather than family connections, making him popular among common soldiers and citizens alike. His youth and energy contrast with older military leaders, and he represents a new generation eager to prove their worth and modernize military practices while respecting tradition.

## Character Traits

- Young and ambitious
- Meritocratic and fair
- Popular with common soldiers
- Energetic and reform-minded
- Loyal to military values

## My Interests

I am determined to prove that youth and merit can serve Kourion as well as age and noble lineage. While I may not seek the crown for myself yet, I am committed to ensuring that our clan's interests are protected and that whoever becomes King recognizes the importance of a strong, well-trained military force loyal to Kourion rather than to foreign powers. I believe that military service should be rewarded based on achievement rather than birth, and I will support any candidate who shares this view.

I fear that the older generation of both military and civilian leaders may be too entrenched in their ways to see the threats we face from more innovative enemies. The Bankers and Philosophers sometimes seem to forget that their ability to debate and count coins depends entirely on the soldiers who keep them safe. I worry particularly that excessive taxation to fund merchant ventures or banking schemes could leave our military undermanned and poorly equipped when we need it most.

I believe our budget must prioritize Military spending not just for naval forces but also for the often-neglected city guard and infantry units that maintain internal order and defend against land-based threats. Social spending is also crucial to ensure that common soldiers and their families are cared for, which maintains loyalty and morale. I favor the Salamis alliance because it represents Greek military values and honor, though I'm open to any arrangement that strengthens our defenses rather than compromising them for commercial gain.
