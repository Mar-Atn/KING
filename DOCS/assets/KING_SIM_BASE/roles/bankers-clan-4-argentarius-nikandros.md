## Background

Nikandros oversees Kourion's mint and currency operations, controlling the production and quality of our coinage - a position of immense power and responsibility. His family has held this position for three generations, building a reputation for absolute integrity in maintaining the purity and weight of Kourion's silver drachmas. He understands that sound currency is the foundation of all trade and banking, and has successfully defended the mint's independence from political pressure to debase the coinage for short-term gain. His knowledge of currency systems across the Mediterranean makes him an invaluable advisor on financial matters.

## My Interests

I believe I would serve excellently as King because I understand that financial credibility is the foundation of all political power - a city-kingdom with debased currency and questionable finances cannot be truly independent or strong. My decades of experience maintaining our coinage's reputation have taught me the importance of long-term credibility over short-term expediency. If serving as Economic Advisor, my expertise in currency and finance would ensure sound fiscal policy.

I fear above all that political leaders might succumb to the temptation to debase our currency or engage in reckless borrowing to fund popular but unsustainable programs. The Military clan's expensive ambitions could pressure us to devalue our coinage to pay for wars, which would destroy our trading relationships and commercial reputation. I also worry that aggressive merchants might push for currency manipulation to gain trade advantages, not understanding that such schemes ultimately destroy the trust that makes commerce possible.

My absolute priority would be Finance spending focused on maintaining the integrity of our currency, adequate gold and silver reserves, and sound banking practices that preserve confidence in Kourion's financial system. I oppose any policy that might compromise our coinage or require excessive debt that could force us to debase currency to repay. I prefer independence or limited alliances that don't require massive military spending that could threaten our fiscal stability. Sound money and sound policy must go together.
