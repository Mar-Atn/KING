## My Interests

I genuinely beleive my approach to strategic planning and resource management  make me a strong candidante to become the new King, not for myself, but for the benefits of the entire kingdom and our glorious clan. I am determined to ensure that whoever becomes King understands the importance of maintaining our financial stability and avoiding the reckless spending that has bankrupted other city-kingdoms. My role is to guide our clan toward the supreme power, or supporting candidates who will prioritize fiscal responsibility over popular  policies. If called upon to serve as Economic Advisor, I would bring the necessary discipline and caution to protect our prosperity.

I fear that political leaders might make popular promises about increased spending or tax reductions without understanding the long-term financial consequences. The Military clan's preference for expensive military projects concerns me because such spending could force us into unsustainable debt relationships or require emergency loans at unfavorable terms. I worry that the Merchants' focus on rapid expansion might lead to speculative investments that could destabilize our financial system if they fail.

I believe our budget should prioritize Finance spending on debt reduction and the maintenance of adequate reserves for emergencies, while avoiding any commitments that could compromise our financial flexibility. I am cautious about foreign alliances that might require expensive military commitments or trade guarantees that could strain our resources. My primary goal is ensuring that our city-kingdom maintains the financial independence and stability that allow us to weather economic storms without becoming dependent on potentially unreliable foreign creditors.
