## My Interests

I am eager to serve as King if our clan believes I can best advance our commercial interests, though I recognize that my youth might make some prefer more experienced candidates. My focus is ensuring that our clan's innovative spirit and entrepreneurial energy shape whatever decisions the new King makes. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to push for bold economic policies that could dramatically increase our prosperity, rather than settling for the cautious approaches that have limited our growth.

My greatest concern is that conservative voices within our own clan might hold us back from seizing the extraordinary opportunities that current circumstances present. I worry that the Military clan's focus on traditional values and the Landlords' preference for stability could prevent us from adapting to the rapidly changing Mediterranean trade environment. If we fail to act decisively, other city-kingdoms might capture the markets and relationships that could make Kourion the dominant trading power in the region.

I believe we must prioritize Trade spending on building new types of vessels and establishing trading posts in distant markets, while Innovation investment should focus on developing new preservation techniques and navigation methods that give us competitive advantages. A strong alliance with Kition would provide access to Persian wealth and Phoenician expertise that could revolutionize our trading capabilities. I am willing to accept higher taxes on our activities if the increased revenue funds expansion projects that multiply our long-term profits.
