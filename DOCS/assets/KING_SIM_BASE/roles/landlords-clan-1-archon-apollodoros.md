## My Interests

As a member of one of the oldest and most respected families in Kourion, I believe I have both the birthright and the responsibility to serve as King during these turbulent times. My family's generations of leadership have prepared me to guide our city-kingdom with the wisdom and stability that comes from understanding our island's deepest traditions. The position of Economic Advisor would also suit my experience, as managing vast agricultural estates has taught me the fundamentals of resource allocation and long-term planning.

I fear that the growing influence of merchants and bankers threatens to transform our noble city-kingdom into a mere commercial enterprise, abandoning the values and traditions that have made us strong. The Military clan's eagerness for war concerns me because conflicts could devastate our agricultural lands and disrupt the seasonal cycles that sustain our people. I worry that the Philosophers' constant questioning of established order could undermine the respect for hierarchy and tradition that keeps our society stable.

I would prioritize Agriculture spending to improve our island's food security and support the farmers who form the backbone of our economy. Finance spending should focus on maintaining stable prices and preventing the market speculation that can ruin harvests and bankrupt honest farmers. I strongly favor an alliance with Salamis, as our Greek brothers share our respect for tradition and would provide reliable markets for our agricultural products without the cultural contamination that might come from closer ties with Persian-influenced Kition.
