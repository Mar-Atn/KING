## Background

Theodoros has built the largest trading fleet in Kourion, with ships that regularly sail to Egyptian ports, Phoenician cities, and Persian markets across the Mediterranean. His family has been involved in copper trade for generations, and he personally negotiated the favorable trading agreements that now provide 30% of our city-kingdom's budget. Known for his shrewd business sense and diplomatic skills, he has earned respect even from rival clans who benefit from the prosperity his trade networks bring to our island.

- Pragmatic and results-oriented
- Confident and persuasive
- Protective of merchant interests

## My Interests

I have proven my leadership abilities through building our trade networks and contributing substantially to our city-kingdom's prosperity, and I believe I am the natural choice to serve as King. My experience in negotiating with foreign powers and managing complex commercial relationships has prepared me to guide Kourion through the challenging political waters we face. The position of Economic Advisor would also suit my talents, as I understand how to balance budgets and maximize revenue better than any member of the other clans.

My greatest fear is that military-minded leaders will prioritize expensive wars over profitable trade, potentially destroying the commercial relationships that sustain our island's prosperity. I worry that the Military clan's obsession with Salamis could drag us into conflicts that benefit no one except weapon-makers and glory-seekers. The Philosophers' idealistic notions about independence and their influence on our youth could undermine the practical compromises necessary for successful international commerce.

I would prioritize Trade spending to expand our harbor facilities and build more merchant vessels, ensuring that our commercial advantages continue to grow. Innovation investment should focus on maritime technologies that improve our trading capabilities and harbor defenses. A strong alliance with Kition would open new markets and provide access to Persian wealth, while their Phoenician connections could teach us new trading techniques that would benefit our entire city-kingdom for generations to come.
