# Clan of Landlords

## About the Clan

Our Clan is one of the two oldest and most noble Clans of Kourion, alongside the Military Clan. We control the vast agricultural lands across the island and contribute significantly to the city-kingdom's food supply and around 30% of the city's budget. 
We believe in the importance of stability, tradition, and maintaining a balance between growth and preservation. The lands we own are the foundation of Kourion's wealth and sustenance; any policy must safeguard our agricultural interests and coastal territories.

## Key Priorities
The best King must be someone who understands the importance of agriculture and land ownership in our island setting. Our candidate must advocate for policies that protect our lands from heavy taxation and external threats. Budget priorities should be Agriculture, Defense of the Coastal Lands (but not unnecessary expansion), and Social Welfare to keep the populace satisfied and stable.
We are cautious about alliances. An alliance with Salamis is preferable as it ensures extra markets for our grain, wine, and olive oil (as militarized Salamis shares our Greek traditions and provides reliable trade) and it also adds to the safety and stability of our island territories. But we must avoid any conflicts that could lead to our fields and coastal settlements being damaged. We oppose any reckless military adventures or decisions that result in high taxation of agricultural produce. An alliance with Kition is acceptable only if it guarantees the protection of our lands, does not trigger a war with Salamis, and does not impose any trade regulations that could harm our interests.

## Attitude to Other Clans
We respect the Military Clan for their role in defending our island territories and traditions, but we fear they may prioritize unnecessary wars, leading to increased taxes and instability. The Merchants and Bankers are beneficial partners as long as they do not seek to exploit our lands through excessive taxes or financial schemes. They are opportunistic dealmakers without true values and integrity. They can not be fully trusted. The Artificers are useful if their innovations can improve agricultural productivity and coastal defense, but they must not disrupt traditional farming methods. The Philosophers can offer guidance, but their ideas should not challenge the established order of landownership, and they should stop their irresponsible propaganda among the youth of our island city-kingdom.

## If Things Go Wrong
If the King's decisions threaten our interests, we might consider withholding our agricultural produce, threatening a famine, and putting pressure on the ruling authority. We can also leverage our influence among the common people, who depend on us for their sustenance, to incite unrest or demand a change in leadership. We may seek support from external allies if our island territories are at risk.
