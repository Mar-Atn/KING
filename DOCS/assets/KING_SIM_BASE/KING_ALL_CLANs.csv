Name,About the Clan,Key Priorities,Attitude to Other Clans,If Things Go Wrong
Clan of Artificers,"Our clan represents the ingenuity and innovation that drive the progress of Kourion. We are skilled in creating both military and civil innovations that enhance the city-kingdom's defenses, infrastructure, and daily life. We believe in the power of technology and scientific advancement to solve problems and improve society. Our inventions have played a crucial role in past naval battles and in maintaining the island's prosperity and safety. The future of Kourion depends on embracing progress and innovation, particularly in maritime technologies and harbor engineering.","The best King must be a visionary leader who supports technological advancement and invests in innovation. Our candidate should push for a substantial portion of the budget to be allocated to Research and Development, Infrastructure Improvement, and Naval Innovations. We need to prioritize projects that enhance the island's coastal defenses, improve its harbors and shipyards, and elevate its status among rival city-kingdoms through superior maritime technology. An alliance with Kition is desirable for us, as their progressive culture and access to Persian and Phoenician innovations align with our goals of technological advancement. Their diverse knowledge from different cultures could enhance our engineering capabilities. However, we are also open to cooperating with Salamis if they support our engineering projects, especially those related to naval defense. We should oppose any decisions that cut funding for innovation or overly prioritize military expenditure at the expense of technological growth.","We respect the Military Clan for their understanding of the practical applications of our innovations, especially in naval warfare and coastal defense. The Merchants are valuable partners as they can help fund our projects and provide access to new materials and technologies from distant lands. The Bankers can provide necessary financing for large-scale engineering projects, though we must ensure they understand the long-term benefits of innovation investments. The Landlords can benefit from our agricultural innovations, but their resistance to change sometimes limits our ability to implement improvements. The Philosophers can offer valuable insights into the ethical implications of our innovations, but their theoretical approach sometimes conflicts with our practical focus.","If the King fails to support innovation or cuts funding for our projects, we could consider withholding our technical expertise, potentially leaving the city-kingdom vulnerable to technological stagnation. We might also seek support from foreign powers that value innovation, such as Persian engineers or Phoenician shipbuilders, though this would be a last resort that could compromise our loyalty to Kourion."
Clan of Bankers,"Our clan is the financial backbone of Kourion, managing the city-kingdom's wealth and resources. We have significant influence over economic activities and possess the unique power to provide loans to the state, supporting its budget in times of need. We believe in pragmatic governance, where financial stability and economic growth are prioritized above all else. Our wealth and resources give us leverage, but we must use them wisely to ensure continued prosperity for both our clan and the island city-kingdom.","The best King must understand the importance of financial stability and support policies that encourage economic growth. Our candidate should advocate for balanced budgets, controlled spending, and lower taxes on banking and financial transactions. We need to ensure that the first budget priorities are Debt Management, Economic Development, and Trade to keep the island's economy thriving and the city-kingdom prosperous. An alliance with Kition is favourable for us because of their access to Persian imperial financing and extensive Phoenician commercial networks, which would increase our opportunities for lending and financial growth across the Mediterranean. An alliance with Salamis could prove detrimental to our interests due to their militaristic nature and traditional Greek values that often view financial accumulation with suspicion. Any decision that leads to economic instability, such as excessive military spending or high taxation, should be opposed.","We value the Merchants for their role in generating wealth and trade opportunities, which create demand for our financial services. The Artificers can contribute to economic growth through their innovations, but their projects must be financially viable and not drain the treasury. The Military Clan's focus on expensive military campaigns concerns us, as it could lead to unsustainable debt or economic instability. The Landlords are important partners as they provide collateral for loans and represent stable wealth, but their resistance to change can sometimes hinder economic development. The Philosophers can offer guidance, but their idealistic notions about debt forgiveness and economic equality could undermine the financial systems that sustain our prosperity.","If the King's policies threaten our financial interests or economic stability, we have the power to restrict loans and credit, potentially causing a financial crisis that could force policy changes. We can also leverage our international connections to seek support from Persian or other foreign financial networks, though this would be a last resort that could compromise our independence."
Clan of Landlords,"Our Clan is one of the two oldest and most noble Clans of Kourion, alongside the Military Clan. We control the vast agricultural lands across the island and contribute significantly to the city-kingdom's food supply and around 30% of the city's budget. We believe in the importance of stability, tradition, and maintaining a balance between growth and preservation. The lands we own are the foundation of Kourion's wealth and sustenance; any policy must safeguard our agricultural interests and coastal territories.","The best King must be someone who understands the importance of agriculture and land ownership in our island setting. Our candidate must advocate for policies that protect our lands from heavy taxation and external threats. Budget priorities should be Agriculture, Defense of the Coastal Lands (but not unnecessary expansion), and Social Welfare to keep the populace satisfied and stable. We are cautious about alliances. An alliance with Salamis is preferable as it ensures extra markets for our grain, wine, and olive oil (as militarized Salamis shares our Greek traditions and provides reliable trade) and it also adds to the safety and stability of our island territories. But we must avoid any conflicts that could lead to our fields and coastal settlements being damaged. We oppose any reckless military adventures or decisions that result in high taxation of agricultural produce. An alliance with Kition is acceptable only if it guarantees the protection of our lands, does not trigger a war with Salamis, and does not impose any trade regulations that could harm our interests.","We respect the Military Clan for their role in defending our island territories and traditions, but we fear they may prioritize unnecessary wars, leading to increased taxes and instability. The Merchants and Bankers are beneficial partners as long as they do not seek to exploit our lands through excessive taxes or financial schemes. They are opportunistic dealmakers without true values and integrity. They can not be fully trusted. The Artificers are useful if their innovations can improve agricultural productivity and coastal defense, but they must not disrupt traditional farming methods. The Philosophers can offer guidance, but their ideas should not challenge the established order of landownership, and they should stop their irresponsible propaganda among the youth of our island city-kingdom.","If the King's decisions threaten our interests, we might consider withholding our agricultural produce, threatening a famine, and putting pressure on the ruling authority. We can also leverage our influence among the common people, who depend on us for their sustenance, to incite unrest or demand a change in leadership. We may seek support from external allies if our island territories are at risk."
Clan of Merchants,"Our clan is vital to the economic health of Kourion, contributing a substantial 30% to the city's budget. We represent trade and commerce, which is the lifeblood of our island city-kingdom. We believe that the growth of maritime trade and economic freedom will bring prosperity to all citizens. We are progressive and believe in fostering alliances that benefit our trade interests, especially with Kition, known for its extensive Phoenician trade networks and access to Persian markets.","The best King must understand the value of commerce and support our economic activities. Our candidate must promise lower taxes on trade and support for merchants to expand their maritime networks across the Mediterranean. Reducing unnecessary military expenditures and redirecting funds toward trade, harbor improvements, and copper export infrastructure is essential. Budget priorities should be Trade, Innovation, and Public Welfare, ensuring stability and growth. An alliance with Kition is beneficial for us. It will increase trade opportunities through their Phoenician connections and allow us to tap into the wealth of Persian imperial markets. An alliance with Salamis could limit our trade opportunities due to their focus on military matters and traditional Greek values that may clash with our commercial innovations. We must oppose any action that leads to increased taxation on trade or hinders our maritime commerce.","We value the Artificers for their innovations that can aid in shipbuilding, harbor construction, and increase trade efficiency across sea routes. However, we see the Military Clan as a potential threat to our interests if they prioritize heavy taxation and military spending over naval commerce protection. The Philosophers can provide valuable counsel, but they must not interfere with commerce, and they have a growing negative impact seducing the minds of ordinary citizens with their dangerous ideas. The Bankers are our closest allies, as they provide the necessary financial support for our maritime trade activities and copper export ventures.","If a ruler does not align with our interests, we could consider using our economic power to oppose unjust taxes. We can halt trade and reduce our contribution to the budget, causing significant impact to the island's economy. We may also consider an alliance with external maritime powers that favour trade over military dominance."
Military Clan,"Our clan is large and mighty, commanding a loyal and disciplined army and navy that is the backbone of Kourion. As one of the two oldest and most noble clans of the city-kingdom (alongside the Landlords), we hold the unique right to bear arms. This is a significant responsibility that we have never taken lightly. Each member of our clan is raised to uphold and defend the laws and sacred traditions of Kourion. We believe that most changes pose a threat, as people tend to become weak and corrupt when they stray from established laws and traditions.","The ideal King should be a strategic thinker and a seasoned warrior who understands both land and naval warfare. Having our candidate ascend to the throne would be the best outcome, as he should avoid making too many promises to other clans and prevent becoming overly dependent on them. In the ongoing rivalry with Salamis and Kition, Kourion requires a robust army and fleet to defend our island territories. This necessitates a higher overall state budget, with increased taxes on all, especially the Merchants and Bankers. The top budget priorities must be the Navy, Coastal Defense, and Military Innovations. We need to expand our forces, strengthen our fleet, and build new fortifications around our harbors. Investment in military innovations is also crucial, along with an increase in the social budget to maintain internal stability; the growing discontent among ordinary citizens could otherwise lead to unrest, potentially exploited by external enemies seeking to control our strategic island position. A decisive military alliance with Salamis is almost essential, and might even outweigh budgetary concerns. Salamis, a Greek city-kingdom where military tradition and strength still prevail, could help us restore our core values and defend against the foreign influences spreading across Cyprus. We understand that such an alliance would almost certainly mean conflict with Kition, but Kition, influenced by Phoenician merchants and Persian gold, lacks the warrior spirit and honor. They will not prevail in such a conflict, and we must make our choice.","We hold deep respect for the ancient and noble Clan of Landlords. We also appreciate the contributions of the Artificers, whose inventions have helped us win crucial naval battles and protect our coastal territories. However, the growing greed and decadence, particularly among the Bankers and Merchants, are slowly eroding the spirit of our island city-kingdom. Their sole focus on wealth and pleasure could weaken Kourion and jeopardize its independence. If they gain full power, our city-kingdom risks losing its strength and sovereignty to foreign influence.","As the only clan with the right to bear arms, we carry the ultimate responsibility to choose the correct path to serve and protect our island city-kingdom. We will not hesitate to use our power to ensure Kourion remains strong, respected, and true to its Greek traditions."
Clan of Philosophers,"Our clan embodies the wisdom, knowledge, and moral conscience of Kourion. We are the keepers of ancient wisdom and advocates for reason, justice, and the well-being of all citizens. We believe that the true strength of a city-kingdom lies in the happiness and enlightenment of its people. Our role is to provide counsel to the rulers, ensure fair governance, and guide Kourion toward a future built on principles of virtue, knowledge, and balance. Nothing stays unchanged with time. But change is dangerous and ordinary people are weak and susceptible to greed, obsession with power and entertainments. Traditions and laws protect us from the bad changes and bad behaviours, so they must be protected. However, we know, that rules and laws are all created by wise people, and, when day comes, right change could be introduced by the wise for the benefit of all.","The best King must be a wise and just leader who values reason over power, knowledge over wealth, and the common good over personal ambition. Our candidate should prioritize Education, Public Welfare, and Fair Governance in the budget to promote social harmony and the enlightenment of the citizens. The King should seek to maintain a balanced approach, avoiding extremes in military aggression or economic exploitation. We believe in a peaceful approach and are against unnecessary wars. The best way for Kourion is to remain unaligned, and allow Salamis and Kition to compete with each other, while Kourion grows stronger by staying independent and learning from both Greek and foreign wisdom. An alliance with Kition, a center of learning that blends Greek, Phoenician, and Persian knowledge, could enrich our intellectual pursuits, though we must be cautious of foreign influences that might corrupt our values. We are not inherently opposed to an alliance with Salamis if it promotes stability and Greek cultural traditions. We must oppose any policies that lead to tyranny, oppression, wars, or the marginalization of knowledge and wisdom.","We respect the Artificers for their rational and innovative thinking, which can advance society when used wisely. We see the Merchants and Bankers as necessary contributors to the island's economy but caution against their pursuit of wealth at the expense of ethical principles and the common good. Their impact on political matters must be restricted. The Landlords are respected for their role in maintaining stability, but we must guide them toward more just and equitable land management practices. The Military Clan is a potential threat if they become overly aggressive or impose martial law; they should be reminded of the values of justice and restraint, especially given our island's position as a crossroads of cultures.","If the King disregards wisdom and justice, or if governance becomes tyrannical, we are prepared to lead a movement of peaceful dissent. We can incite the people to revolt through our teachings and influence or consider self-exile to a city-kingdom more aligned with our values, such as centers of learning in Kition or the Greek mainland. In the face of oppression, we will not remain silent but will use our influence to inspire change and restore balance and reason to the governance of Kourion."
