# The New King - Master Implementation Plan

**Project:** Ancient Cyprus Political Simulation Platform
**Created:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Foundation & Auth) - Moving to Phase 2

---

## üéØ Vision

Build a complete web-based political simulation platform where 15-20 human participants + 5-10 AI characters engage in an immersive Ancient Cyprus leadership experience. The system must support facilitator-led sessions with a fixed 12-phase process, real-time interaction, AI-powered characters with voice, voting mechanisms, and reflection/analytics.
