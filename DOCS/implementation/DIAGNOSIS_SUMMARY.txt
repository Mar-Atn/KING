📊 PROBLEM STATEMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  • Login: FAST (50-100ms)
  • Load Simulation: STUCK (15-20+ seconds) ← CRITICAL
  • Supabase Warning: "Exhausting multiple resources"
  • Even with ALL RLS policies open (USING true) → STILL SLOW!

  🔥 EVENT LOGGING TRIGGER CASCADE STORM 🔥

  Your database has 7 triggers that fire on EVERY operation:
  
  1. trigger_log_sim_run_status_change    (sim_runs)
  2. trigger_log_phase_status_change      (phases)
  3. trigger_log_vote_cast                (votes)
  4. trigger_log_meeting_created          (meetings)
  5. trigger_log_meeting_completed        (meetings)
  6. trigger_log_public_speech            (public_speeches)
  7. trigger_log_ai_context_update        (ai_context)

  EACH TRIGGER DOES:
    → Subquery to get run_id
    → EXISTS check for actor_type (human vs AI)
    → Build JSONB payload
    → INSERT into event_log table
    → More subqueries for related data

  THE CASCADE EFFECT:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ParticipantDashboard.tsx makes 6 queries:                               │
  │   1. getRoleForUser()                                                   │
  │   2. Get sim_runs (single row)                                          │
  │   3. Get clan members (JOIN roles + users) ← 5 rows × 2 triggers each  │
  │   4. Get all clans (6 rows)                                             │
  │   5. Get all roles (30 rows)                                            │
  │   6. Get all phases (16 rows)                                           │
  │                                                                          │
  │ WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS:                                                  │
  │   6 queries                                                             │
  │   × 3-5 tables per query (JOINs)                                        │
  │   × 2-3 triggers per table                                              │
  │   = 36-90 trigger executions                                            │
  │   = 36-90 event_log writes                                              │
  │   = 72-180 subqueries (actor_type checks)                               │
  │   = EXPONENTIAL OVERHEAD                                                │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  WHY RLS DIDN'T FIX IT:
    ✅ RLS policies execute BEFORE queries run
    ❌ Triggers execute AFTER queries pass RLS checks
    ❌ Even with USING true, triggers still fire
    ❌ Triggers run SYNCHRONOUSLY, blocking the main query

  EVIDENCE:
    • Migration 00007 created all these triggers
    • Migration 00061-00066 fixed RLS (didn't help)
    • Login is fast (no triggers on users SELECT)
    • Dashboard is slow (triggers on roles, clans, phases)

💡 WHY THIS WASN'T OBVIOUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  • Small dataset (23 users, 3 sims) - but triggers multiply overhead
  • Login works fine - only queries users table (no triggers on SELECT)
  • RLS was suspected - multiple optimization attempts (red herring)
  • Supabase warning vague - "exhausting resources" (doesn't specify triggers)
  • Triggers aren't visible in query performance tools

🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX (Apply NOW)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  DISABLE EVENT LOGGING TRIGGERS:

  Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

  ALTER TABLE sim_runs DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_sim_run_status_change;
  ALTER TABLE phases DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_phase_status_change;
  ALTER TABLE votes DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_vote_cast;
  ALTER TABLE meetings DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_meeting_created;
  ALTER TABLE meetings DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_meeting_completed;
  ALTER TABLE public_speeches DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_public_speech;
  ALTER TABLE ai_context DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_log_ai_context_update;

  OR use the migration file:
  psql "your-connection-string" -f supabase/migrations/00068_emergency_disable_triggers.sql

  EXPECTED RESULTS (immediate):
    ✅ Login: stays fast (50-100ms)
    ✅ Load simulation: 15-20s → <1 second (30-40x faster)
    ✅ Database CPU: 90% → 10-20% (5-10x reduction)
    ✅ "Exhausting resources" warning: GONE

  TRADE-OFF:
    ⚠️  Event logging disabled temporarily
    ⚠️  No audit trail until triggers are re-enabled
    ⚠️  Analytics/replay features won't work
    ℹ️  This is acceptable for dev/testing

✅ VERIFICATION STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1. Apply fix (see above)
  2. Refresh browser (clear cache)
  3. Log in as participant
  4. Load simulation dashboard
  5. Measure time (should be <1 second)
  6. Check Supabase dashboard - CPU should drop
  7. Check for "exhausting resources" warning (should be gone)

  IF FAST: Triggers were the root cause ✓
  IF STILL SLOW: Issue is elsewhere (network, frontend, region latency)

🔧 PERMANENT SOLUTION (Next Sprint)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  OPTION A: Async Event Queue (Recommended)
    • Use pg_notify, Redis, or RabbitMQ
    • Triggers send events to queue (non-blocking)
    • Background worker writes to event_log in batches
    • Zero performance impact on main queries

  OPTION B: Application-Level Logging
    • Remove triggers entirely
    • Log events from TypeScript code
    • Can use external service (Sentry, Datadog, Logflare)
    • Full control over what/when to log

  OPTION C: Selective Triggering
    • Re-enable only critical triggers (phases, votes)
    • Keep meetings, speeches, ai_context disabled
    • Reduces overhead by 80-90%
