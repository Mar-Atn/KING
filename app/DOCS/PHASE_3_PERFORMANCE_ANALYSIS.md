RLS Evaluation:         ~10-30ms   (7-21%)
Query + Joins:          ~10-30ms   (7-21%)
Total Expected:         ~100-160ms
```

## Part 2: RLS Policy Analysis

### Duplicate Policies Detected

Migration 00024_check_duplicates.sql identified duplicate permissive policies:

#### access_tokens Table
- **Issue:** 2 SELECT policies
- **Policies:**
  1. "Users can view their own access tokens"
  2. "View access tokens"
- **Impact:** PostgreSQL evaluates BOTH policies (OR logic)
- **Overhead:** ~5-15ms additional per query

#### users Table
- **Issue:** 2 INSERT policies
- **Policies:**
  1. "Service role can create users"
  2. "Users can insert their own profile"
- **Impact:** Both evaluated on every INSERT
- **Overhead:** ~5-15ms additional per insert

### Multiple Permissive Policies (Performance Advisor Warnings)

**Supabase Performance Advisor reported 27 warnings** about multiple permissive policies. When multiple policies exist for the same action (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), PostgreSQL must evaluate ALL of them with OR logic.

**Example from sim_runs table:**
```sql
-- Policy 1: Facilitators can see all
CREATE POLICY "sim_runs_facilitator_all" ON sim_runs
  FOR ALL USING (is_facilitator());

-- Policy 2: Participants see their simulations
CREATE POLICY "sim_runs_participant_select" ON sim_runs
  FOR SELECT USING (is_participant_in_run(run_id));
```

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Check is_facilitator() - function call + query
2. If false, check is_participant_in_run() - another function call + query
3. If either returns true, allow access

**Optimization Opportunity:**
- Consolidate policies where possible
- Use single policy with conditional logic
- Consider role-based switching instead of OR evaluation

## Part 3: Network Latency Analysis

### Geographic Latency

**Database Location:** EU North 1 (Stockholm)
**Client Location:** [Your location - likely significant distance]

**Estimated Latency:**
- Same region: 5-20ms
- EU to EU: 20-50ms
- US to EU: 80-150ms
- Asia to EU: 150-300ms

**Current Observed:** ~80-100ms suggests cross-region access

### Recommendations

**Short Term:**
- Accept current latency (not critical for simulation platform)
- Focus on RLS policy optimization instead

**Long Term (if needed):**
- Consider Supabase edge functions for complex queries
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Use GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates

---

## Part 4: Query Optimization Opportunities

### High-Priority Optimizations

#### 1. Consolidate Duplicate RLS Policies
**Impact:** Medium (10-20ms reduction)
**Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)
**Status:** Should fix

**Action Items:**
- Remove duplicate policy on access_tokens
- Remove duplicate policy on users
- Test that access control still works
- Document consolidated policy logic

#### 2. Review and Consolidate Permissive Policies
**Impact:** High (20-50ms potential reduction)
**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours)
**Status:** Recommended

**Tables to Review:**
- sim_runs (facilitator + participant policies)
- clans (multiple access patterns)
- roles (complex access logic)
- meetings, votes (multiple permissive policies)

**Strategy:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (multiple policies)
CREATE POLICY policy_1 FOR SELECT USING (condition_1());
CREATE POLICY policy_2 FOR SELECT USING (condition_2());

-- AFTER (single consolidated policy)
CREATE POLICY unified_policy FOR SELECT USING (
  condition_1() OR condition_2()
);
```

#### 3. Optimize RLS Helper Functions
**Impact:** Medium (10-20ms reduction)
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)
**Status:** Consider

Current helper functions:
- `is_facilitator()` - looks up user role
- `is_participant_in_run(run_id)` - checks role assignment
- `get_current_user_role_id(run_id)` - retrieves role

**Optimization Ideas:**
- Cache role lookups in session
- Use SET LOCAL for session variables
- Combine multiple checks into single query

### Medium-Priority Optimizations

#### 4. Add Strategic Indexes
**Impact:** Low now, High with data
**Effort:** Low (1 hour)
**Status:** Proactive

**Recommended Indexes:**
```sql
-- Frequently filtered columns
CREATE INDEX idx_sim_runs_facilitator ON sim_runs(facilitator_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sim_runs_status ON sim_runs(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_roles_assigned_user ON roles(assigned_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_roles_run_clan ON roles(run_id, clan_id);

-- RLS policy support
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);
CREATE INDEX idx_access_tokens_user ON access_tokens(user_id);
```

#### 5. Implement Query Result Caching
**Impact:** High for repeated queries
**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours)
**Status:** Future enhancement

**Strategy:**
- Cache simulation templates (rarely change)
- Cache user profiles (change infrequently)
- Use SWR (stale-while-revalidate) pattern
- Invalidate cache on mutations

  },
  global: {
    headers: {
      'x-client-info': 'sim-platform/1.0',
    },
  },
  // Add timing middleware
})

// Log slow queries
supabase.on('query', (event) => {
  if (event.duration > 200) {
    console.warn('Slow query detected:', {
      table: event.table,

## Part 8: Conclusion

### Current State: ACCEPTABLE ‚úÖ

The New King SIM platform has **acceptable performance** for its use case. The 100-150ms query times (with network latency) are within normal ranges for a remote database and will not impact user experience for an educational simulation platform.

### Key Takeaways

1. **No Crisis:** Performance is adequate, not urgent to optimize
2. **Easy Wins Available:** Duplicate policies can be fixed quickly
3. **Solid Foundation:** Good schema design, proper RLS implementation
4. **Room for Growth:** Clear optimization path when/if needed

### Recommended Next Steps

**Priority Order:**
1. ‚úÖ Document findings (this document) - DONE
2. üéØ Fix duplicate RLS policies - 1-2 hours
3. üéØ Add recommended indexes - 1 hour
4. üéØ Load seed data and re-test - 2 hours
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Policy consolidation - defer until needed
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è Advanced optimizations - defer until growth requires it

### Decision: Phase 4 Not Needed

Based on this analysis, **Phase 4 (major RLS refactor) is not recommended**. The current architecture is sound and performance is acceptable. Focus instead on:
- Building features with confidence
- Monitoring performance as usage grows
- Making incremental optimizations as needed

## Appendix B: RLS Policy Inventory

### Tables with Multiple Permissive Policies

1. **sim_runs** (2 policies)
   - facilitator_all (FOR ALL)
   - participant_select (FOR SELECT)

2. **clans** (2 policies)
   - facilitator_all
   - participant_select

3. **roles** (2 policies)
   - facilitator_all
   - participant_select

4. **phases** (2 policies)
   - facilitator_all
   - participant_select

5. **access_tokens** (2 SELECT policies - DUPLICATE)
   - Users can view their own
   - View access tokens

6. **users** (2 INSERT policies - DUPLICATE)
   - Service role can create
   - Users can insert own profile

### Consolidation Opportunities

**Pattern 1: Facilitator + Participant (6 tables)**
```sql
-- Current (2 policies)
facilitator_all: FOR ALL USING (is_facilitator())
participant_select: FOR SELECT USING (is_participant_in_run(run_id))

-- Proposed (1 policy)
unified_access: FOR ALL USING (
  is_facilitator() OR
  (current_setting('request.method') = 'SELECT' AND is_participant_in_run(run_id))
)
```

**Pattern 2: Duplicate Cleanup (2 tables)**
- Simply remove the redundant policy
- Keep the more specific one
- Test access control thoroughly
