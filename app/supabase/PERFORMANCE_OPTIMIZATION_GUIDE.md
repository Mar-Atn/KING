# Supabase Performance Optimization Guide

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Project:** The New King SIM
**Issue:** High resource load + Performance Advisor warnings

---

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Auth RLS Initialization Plan** (20+ warnings)
**Problem:** RLS policies call `auth.uid()` for EACH ROW instead of once per query

**Impact:**
- 10-100x slower queries on large tables
- High CPU usage
- Suboptimal query performance at scale

**Affected Tables:**
- `sim_runs`, `users`, `access_tokens`, `roles`, `meetings`, `meeting_invitations`, `votes`, `king_decisions`, `reflections`, `facilitator_actions` (and more)

**Example Bad Code:**
```sql
USING (assigned_user_id = auth.uid())  -- ❌ Called for EVERY row
```

**Fix:**
```sql
USING (assigned_user_id = (SELECT auth.uid()))  -- ✅ Called ONCE per query
```

---

### 2. **Multiple Permissive Policies** (30+ warnings)
**Problem:** Multiple RLS policies exist for same role+action combination

**Impact:**
- Postgres evaluates ALL policies for every query
- Redundant policy checks
- Increased query latency

**Example:**
```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Two separate policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ...;
CREATE POLICY "Facilitators can view all users" ...;

-- ✅ GOOD: Single consolidated policy
CREATE POLICY "View users"
USING (id = (SELECT auth.uid()) OR is_facilitator());
```

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Migration 00021: Optimize RLS Performance
**What it does:**
1. ✅ Wraps ALL `auth.uid()` calls in subqueries
2. ✅ Recreates helper functions as `STABLE` (better optimization)
3. ✅ Optimizes 20+ RLS policies
4. ✅ Adds performance indexes on frequently queried columns
5. ✅ Updates table statistics for query planner

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/00021_optimize_rls_performance.sql`

**Key Optimizations:**
- `is_facilitator()` → Uses `SELECT auth.uid()` internally
- `is_participant_in_run()` → Uses `SELECT auth.uid()` internally
- All policies updated to use optimized functions

**New Indexes Added:**
```sql
idx_roles_assigned_user_id     -- Fast user→role lookups
idx_roles_run_user             -- Composite index for participant checks
idx_meetings_participants      -- GIN index for JSONB array
idx_votes_voter_session        -- Fast vote queries
idx_meeting_invitations_invitee -- Fast invitation lookups
idx_reflections_role_phase     -- Fast reflection queries
idx_event_log_run_timestamp    -- Fast event log queries
idx_users_role                 -- Fast role checks
```

### Migration 00022: Consolidate Duplicate Policies
**What it does:**
1. ✅ Merges duplicate policies into single comprehensive policies
2. ✅ Uses OR conditions instead of multiple policies
3. ✅ Reduces policy evaluation overhead
4. ✅ Maintains security while improving performance

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/00022_consolidate_duplicate_policies.sql`

**Key Consolidations:**
- `users`: 4 SELECT policies → 1 consolidated policy
- `access_tokens`: 2 SELECT policies → 1 consolidated policy
- `meetings`: 3 policies (view/create/update) → 3 consolidated policies
- `votes`: 3 SELECT policies → 1 consolidated policy
- All facilitator + participant policies merged with OR conditions

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
```
🔴 20+ auth.uid() warnings
🔴 30+ duplicate policy warnings
🔴 High CPU usage
🔴 Slow participant dashboard loads
🔴 Inefficient query plans
```

### After Optimization
```
✅ All auth.uid() calls optimized (single evaluation)
✅ All duplicate policies consolidated
✅ 10-100x faster RLS evaluation
✅ Reduced CPU usage by ~50%
✅ Faster query planning
✅ 8 new performance indexes
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Review Migrations
```bash
cd /Users/maratatnashev/Desktop/CODING/KING/app

# Review migration files
cat supabase/migrations/00021_optimize_rls_performance.sql
cat supabase/migrations/00022_consolidate_duplicate_policies.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Supabase
```bash
# Option A: Deploy via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Deploy via Dashboard
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# 2. Paste 00021_optimize_rls_performance.sql → Run
# 3. Paste 00022_consolidate_duplicate_policies.sql → Run
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check applied migrations
supabase migration list

# Check for errors in logs
# Dashboard → Logs → Postgres Logs
```

### Step 4: Verify Performance Advisor
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Advisors** → **Performance**
3. Verify all warnings are resolved:
   - ✅ `auth_rls_initplan` warnings should be 0
   - ✅ `multiple_permissive_policies` warnings should be 0

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these critical flows:

### Facilitator Tests
- [ ] Login as facilitator
- [ ] View simulation list
- [ ] Create new simulation
- [ ] Start simulation and manage phases
- [ ] View all participants and roles
- [ ] View all votes and meetings
- [ ] Access analytics and event log

### Participant Tests
- [ ] Login as participant
- [ ] View assigned role and clan info
- [ ] View only own simulation (not others')
- [ ] Create and join meetings
- [ ] Cast votes
- [ ] Submit reflections
- [ ] View only own reflections (not others')

### Cross-Simulation Isolation
- [ ] User in Sim A cannot see data from Sim B
- [ ] Participant can only access simulations they're assigned to
- [ ] Facilitator can see all simulations

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Dashboard loads < 2 seconds
- [ ] Simulation list loads < 1 second
- [ ] Phase transitions are instant (< 500ms)
- [ ] Vote submission is instant
- [ ] No console errors or RLS violations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Policies not working after migration
**Cause:** Policy name conflicts or missing policies
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check existing policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY tablename;

-- Recreate problematic policy manually
-- (see migration files for correct syntax)
```

### Issue: Users can't access their data
**Cause:** Broken RLS policy or missing helper function
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Verify helper functions exist
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('is_facilitator', 'is_participant_in_run');

-- Test helper function
SELECT is_facilitator();
SELECT is_participant_in_run('your-run-id-here');
```

### Issue: High resource usage still persists
**Cause:** Table statistics not updated or missing indexes
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Manually update statistics
ANALYZE users;
ANALYZE roles;
ANALYZE sim_runs;
ANALYZE meetings;
ANALYZE votes;

-- Check if indexes were created
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%';
```

## 📈 Monitoring Performance

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Before Optimization (Baseline):**
- Dashboard load time: ___ seconds
- Simulation list query: ___ ms
- Phase transition time: ___ ms
- CPU usage during active simulation: ___ %

**After Optimization (Target):**
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
- Simulation list query: < 500ms
- Phase transition time: < 200ms
- CPU usage during active simulation: < 30%

### Monitoring Tools
1. **Supabase Dashboard** → **Performance** → **Query Performance**
2. **Supabase Dashboard** → **Advisors** → **Performance**
3. **Supabase Dashboard** → **Logs** → **Postgres Logs**

---

## 📋 Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Supabase CLI)
```bash
# Not recommended for production, but available
supabase db reset  # ⚠️ WARNING: This wipes ALL data!
```

### Option 2: Manual Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous migration state
# This requires recreating the old policies manually
# (Not ideal, better to fix forward)
```

### Option 3: Fix Forward
```bash
# Best approach: Fix specific issues while keeping optimizations
# Example: Recreate a single broken policy
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name ...;
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
1. ✅ All Performance Advisor warnings resolved
2. ✅ All user flows working correctly
3. ✅ Dashboard loads < 2 seconds
4. ✅ No RLS violations in logs
5. ✅ CPU usage reduced by ~50%
6. ✅ Query performance improved 10-100x
