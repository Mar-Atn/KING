We need to ensure that the first budget priorities are Debt Management, Economic Development, and Trade to keep the island''s economy thriving and the city-kingdom prosperous. An alliance with Kition is favourable for us because of their access to Persian imperial financing and extensive Phoenician commercial networks, which would increase our opportunities for lending and financial growth across the Mediterranean.

This is a significant responsibility that we have never taken lightly. Each member of our clan is raised to uphold and defend the laws and sacred traditions of Kourion. We believe that most changes pose a threat, as people tend to become weak and corrupt when they stray from established laws and traditions.',
      'key_priorities', 'The ideal King should be a strategic thinker and a seasoned warrior who understands both land and naval warfare. Having our candidate ascend to the throne would be the best outcome, as he should avoid making too many promises to other clans and prevent becoming overly dependent on them. In the ongoing rivalry with Salamis and Kition, Kourion requires a robust army and fleet to defend our island territories. This necessitates a higher overall state budget, with increased taxes on all, especially the Merchants and Bankers. The top budget priorities must be the Navy, Coastal Defense, and Military Innovations. We need to expand our forces, strengthen our fleet, and build new fortifications around our harbors. Investment in military innovations is also crucial, along with an increase in the social budget to maintain internal stability; the growing discontent among ordinary citizens could otherwise lead to unrest, potentially exploited by external enemies seeking to control our strategic island position. A decisive military alliance with Salamis is almost essential, and might even outweigh budgetary concerns. Salamis, a Greek city-kingdom where military tradition and strength still prevail, could help us restore our core values and defend against the foreign influences spreading across Cyprus. We understand that such an alliance would almost certainly mean conflict with Kition, but Kition, influenced by Phoenician merchants and Persian gold, lacks the warrior spirit and honor. They will not prevail in such a conflict, and we must make our choice.',
      'attitude_to_others', 'We hold deep respect for the ancient and noble Clan of Landlords. We also appreciate the contributions of the Artificers, whose inventions have helped us win crucial naval battles and protect our coastal territories. However, the growing greed and decadence, particularly among the Bankers and Merchants, are slowly eroding the spirit of our island city-kingdom.

The King should seek to maintain a balanced approach, avoiding extremes in military aggression or economic exploitation. We believe in a peaceful approach and are against unnecessary wars. The best way for Kourion is to remain unaligned, and allow Salamis and Kition to compete with each other, while Kourion grows stronger by staying independent and learning from both Greek and foreign wisdom. An alliance with Kition, a center of learning that blends Greek, Phoenician, and Persian knowledge, could enrich our intellectual pursuits, though we must be cautious of foreign influences that might corrupt our values.

      'interests', E'While I respect the experience of my senior colleagues, I believe our clan needs fresh leadership that can navigate the complex challenges facing Kourion. I am willing to serve as King if called upon, but I am equally prepared to support a candidate who truly understands the need for military innovation and strategic flexibility. The position of Economic Advisor would allow me to bridge the gap between military necessities and financial realities, ensuring our defenses remain strong without bankrupting our city-kingdom.\n\nI fear that rigid adherence to old ways could leave us vulnerable to enemies who have adapted new tactics and technologies. The Merchants\' focus on profit over security concerns me, but I also worry that complete rejection of their innovations might weaken our position. My greatest concern is that political divisions within our city-kingdom could prevent us from responding effectively to external threats, whether they come from Egyptian fleets, Assyrian armies, or Persian gold undermining our allies.\n\nI would prioritize a balanced approach to governance, ensuring that Military spending focuses on both traditional strengths and new innovations in naval warfare. I believe we must invest in Innovation to develop better ships, weapons, and fortifications, while maintaining adequate Social spending to keep our citizen-soldiers motivated and loyal. Regarding alliances, I favor careful negotiation with both Salamis and Kition, choosing the partnership that best serves our long-term security rather than rushing into emotional decisions based on cultural preferences alone.'

His family has held military positions since the founding of our city-kingdom, and he embodies the ancient virtues of courage, honor, and unwavering loyalty to clan and city.

My focus is ensuring that whoever becomes King understands that our clan\'s strength and unity are essential for Kourion\'s survival. If I cannot serve as King, I would be honored to advise the ruler on military matters, using my experience to guide decisions that affect our warriors and our city\'s defense.\n\nThe greatest threat to our clan comes from those who would weaken our military traditions through compromise and foreign influence. I deeply distrust the Bankers and Merchants, who seem willing to sell our independence for profit, and I worry that their soft living has made them forget what it means to defend our island with blood and iron. The Philosophers\' constant questioning of established order undermines the discipline and unity that our military requires, potentially creating divisions when we need solidarity most.\n\nI would demand that any King prioritize Military spending above all else, ensuring our warriors have the best equipment, training, and support our city-kingdom can provide. Social spending must also remain strong to maintain the loyalty of our citizen-soldiers and their families. I firmly believe we must align with Salamis, our Greek brothers who share our warrior values and traditional ways, rather than compromise our honor through deals with Persian-influenced Kition or attempt to stand alone against the growing threats surrounding our island.'

My experience commanding fleets has taught me that protecting commerce is as important as winning battles, and I believe this balanced perspective is what our city-kingdom needs. If not King, I would serve excellently as Economic Advisor, as I understand how military spending and economic prosperity must be carefully balanced to ensure both security and wealth.\n\nI fear that rigid military traditionalists might alienate the economic clans whose resources fund our defenses, while I also worry that merchant-minded leaders might neglect our security until it\'s too late. The greatest danger would be a King who doesn\'t understand that naval power protects trade, and trade funds naval power - breaking this cycle would weaken us fatally. I\'m also concerned that internal divisions could leave our waters vulnerable to pirates or foreign navies at a time when maritime threats are increasing.\n\nMy priority would be Military spending focused specifically on naval expansion and coastal fortifications, but balanced with Trade spending to ensure the prosperity that funds our defenses. I support maintaining strong relationships with both Salamis (for military cooperation) and Kition (for trade), believing that wise diplomacy can give us the benefits of both alliances without becoming dependent on either. I would ensure that our navy protects merchant ships as vigorously as it defends our shores.'

I believe that military service should be rewarded based on achievement rather than birth, and I will support any candidate who shares this view.\n\nI fear that the older generation of both military and civilian leaders may be too entrenched in their ways to see the threats we face from more innovative enemies. The Bankers and Philosophers sometimes seem to forget that their ability to debate and count coins depends entirely on the soldiers who keep them safe. I worry particularly that excessive taxation to fund merchant ventures or banking schemes could leave our military undermanned and poorly equipped when we need it most.\n\nI believe our budget must prioritize Military spending not just for naval forces but also for the often-neglected city guard and infantry units that maintain internal order and defend against land-based threats. Social spending is also crucial to ensure that common soldiers and their families are cared for, which maintains loyalty and morale. I favor the Salamis alliance because it represents Greek military values and honor, though I\'m open to any arrangement that strengthens our defenses rather than compromising them for commercial gain.'

Social spending to maintain the warrior class and honor our veterans is essential. I strongly support the Salamis alliance, as they share our Greek martial values and would be reliable allies in battle, unlike the merchant-minded Phoenicians of Kition who would likely abandon us if trade interests conflicted with military obligations.'

I also worry that the economic clans may underestimate emerging military threats, particularly from new powers developing in the eastern Mediterranean who combine military strength with economic sophistication.\n\nI believe the budget must balance Military spending with Innovation spending, as future wars will be won by those who combine traditional strength with new technologies and tactics. I am less concerned with whether we ally with Salamis or Kition than with ensuring any alliance is strategic rather than sentimental - we should partner with whoever can help us maintain security while preserving our independence.
